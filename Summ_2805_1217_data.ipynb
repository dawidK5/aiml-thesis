Thanks - Khairul <USER> @AirAsiaSupport @115802 @121276 never seen somebody sooo least bothered about customer... feel cheated.. and feel robbed... @AirAsiaSupport did nt expect this from such a reputed airlines... #cheated #robbed <SYSTEM> @366867 Terribly sorry for the inconvenience but if you make a flight change, the baggage will be transfered to your new flight. However, @366867 if you make a new booking, it can not be transferred since it is a totally different booking. -Yana <USER> @AirAsiaSupport as a basic courtesy and for customer satisfaction u can take so little of efforts... remember a satisfied customer is a best marketing @AirAsiaSupport its a request plz support <SYSTEM> @366867 Really sorry Saim, but they're non-transferable and non-refundable.
