Here's how: <URL> <USER> @MicrosoftHelps wouldn't help in this situation. Issue is that last night I hit ""shut down and update"" with no warning that it wasn't a usual 30-second update but that it would take 30-40 mins instead.

"<USER> @Tesco Hi. Pe-ordered #StarWarsBattlefrontII at your Chichester store as the promo card said would receive #StarWarsTheLastJedi skins... @Tesco something's gone wrong somewhere? Can you help/advise? #StarWarsBattlefrontII #tesco #dissapointedsonafterschool @Tesco <URL> <SYSTEM> @740448 Hi Shenman, they should be inside the packaging. Please contact the game creators. They should be able to advise further with it not being inside - Allyn <USER> @Tesco but as pre-order how would retailers know which product to hand out to pre-orders as all look same? @116089 @141157 can U shed light? @Tesco @116089 @141157 @127852  can you 'help'? <SYSTEM> @740448 Hiya, having worked in a store myself, I can tell you that any pre-order games come in a separate delivery to the main stock we will sell. This is to avoid those who made a pre-order not getting the new game as soon as it is released. TY <USER> @Tesco thanks but I checked and they only had one version of the game. No distinction between pre order and regular stock? @Tesco so if I follow the logic here I was given the wrong copy? If your staff new nothing off the promotion (which they didn't) then they @Tesco may have been giving out the pre-order copies to people who were just buying the regular game? I'm not trying to be awkward @Tesco but I would just like what I was sold and what I actually paid in advance for. There must be some way of supplying your customers @Tesco correctly. I was told by staff in store that if you order via Direct they email the codes. So surely it must be possible for you to @Tesco supply them to me that way? It would be nice to think Tesco care about resolving things like this for their customers and doing @Tesco what is fair and correct. <SYSTEM> @740448 Hi there, I've spoken to my Support Team to confirm, and they've advised that you would need to speak to EA. TY. - Mart",The customer is appealing that he missed something in his pre ordered shopping.The agent asking the customer to check inside the packing and advising the customer to speak to EA.

They can’t seem to help me, and I’m paying for a service I’m not receiving.😢 <SYSTEM> @529736 We don't offer support unless you have a box.
