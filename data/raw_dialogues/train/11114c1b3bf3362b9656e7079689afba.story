Customer: @115888 any idea when you’ll fix the WiFi glitch?

Music won’t load when connected to work WiFi.

Forums show this is a known issue?

Agent: @524904 Hi Nicole, help's here!

Can you let us know your device's model, OS, and Spotify version?

We'll see what we can suggest /DV

Customer: @SpotifyCares Spotify version 8.4.25.906/happening since September 20th on my old iPhone 6, my new 8+ and iPad Pro.

iOS versions 10, 11, 11.1, and 11.2.

Agent: @524904 Got it.

Can you try to see if logging out &gt; restarting your phone &gt; logging back in to your account makes a difference?

/DV

Customer: @SpotifyCares Now I can’t log in but our network is fine https://t.co/83HBYez2BU

Agent: @524904 No worries.

If possible, does restarting your router help?

Also, does this happen with our WiFi networks?

/DV

Customer: @SpotifyCares Router restarted.

Only able to login if not connected to WiFi.

IT dept says “it’s a known Spotify issue” 🙄🤷🏼‍♀️ Works fine on other WiFi’s.

Agent: @524904 Just to confirm, are you using a private or public WiFi network?

Also, do you have access to a different network you could try with?

/BH

Customer: @SpotifyCares Private WiFi.

No issues w/home WiFi.

My IT dept says it’s a “known Spotify issue”; but they are likely wrong.

TY for troubleshooting

Agent: @524904 Could you send us your account's username or email address?

We'll take a look backstage /TM
