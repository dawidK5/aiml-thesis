Customer: Trying to get through to @Tesco on the phone is like some cruel puzzle!

ðŸ˜‚ I just need to know if they have Cat Carriers!

Customer: @Tesco 20 minutes later and pretending to be a contractor, I finally got through!

To the actual store.

This seems a very long way around asking Qs.

Agent: @338169 Hi Tina, were you able to get the answer you were looking for?

Customer: @Tesco Eventually.

Could have walked there in that time though ðŸ™ˆ I'd suggest trying the phoneline yourself &amp; you'll understand the pain.
