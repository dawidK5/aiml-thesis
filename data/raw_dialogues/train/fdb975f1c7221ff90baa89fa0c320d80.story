Customer: @AppleSupport having a strange problem with Apple Watch since last update please help!

ðŸ˜©

Agent: @315979 We're here and happy to help.

To start, can you tell us what's happening with your Apple Watch?

Customer: @AppleSupport I canâ€™t see peopleâ€™s texts who donâ€™t own Apple products.

Like, the watch shows when they text me but I canâ€™t open the message app to read it

Customer: @AppleSupport And when I added a friend to a group message who has an android, it wonâ€™t let me open the group message even when iPhone users reply

Customer: @AppleSupport I CAN see it in the quick response screen (clicking on the message right when I see it) but cannot go back into messages to reread it

Agent: @315979 We know how important it is to be able to see your messages.

Which model Apple Watch and watchOS are you using?

Customer: @AppleSupport Watch os 4.0 and series 1 38mm

Customer: @AppleSupport I resyncâ€™d the phone and watch and it let me see my friends reply, but when I try to reply to him, it just says â€œsending and then it fails

Agent: @315979 Thanks.
