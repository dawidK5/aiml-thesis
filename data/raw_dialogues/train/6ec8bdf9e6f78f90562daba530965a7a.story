Customer: The fact that @GWRHelp don’t put ‘super off peak’ options on self derived machines enrages me behind words.

Making me pay £10 extra for absolutely no reason?

Nooo buddy 👋🏼

Agent: @765748 Hello.

Can you clarify what you mean please?

Can you give details?

Natalie

Customer: @GWRHelp On the self-service machines you’re never able to select ‘super off peak’ - only off peak.

Event though I AM on a super off peak train.

Luckily I had a lovely ticket man who let me buy a super off peak off him without hassle

Agent: @765748 Which station was this please and what time did you try to buy a ticket?

Did you speak to staff at the station?

Natalie

Customer: @GWRHelp No staff at the station and it’s on all ticket machines including Paddington

Agent: @765748 Which station did you go to and what's the full journey please?

Super Off-Peak should be an option if this fare is available on a specific journey but it may not necessarily show on the favourite/common fares screen.
