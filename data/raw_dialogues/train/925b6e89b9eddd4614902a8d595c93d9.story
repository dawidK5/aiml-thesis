Customer: @marksandspencer Hi.

Thanks fr your help.I must admit it is v disappointing that you promote something.

Have no stock on line, say you have stock in stores which disappears when I try to find it - especially after being recommended to get this cost by one of your own styling services.

Agent: @414546 We're sorry you've been left disappointed, Jo our products are subject to availability so we're not always .
