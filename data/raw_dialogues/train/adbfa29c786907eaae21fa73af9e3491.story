Customer: @British_Airways @British_Airways I have...in order to progress to the next level itâ€™s either I have to collect tier points+ 2 flights or do 25 flights

Agent: @614345 That's right, Mikaela.

We sometimes amend the Terms and Conditions of the Executive Club but can't say when the next time will be ^Julie

Customer: @British_Airways I do understand that you do amend the terms &amp; condition but it never say that we lost the flights we have collected once the tier point ends

Customer: @British_Airways It was not mentioned that we have to collect those flights within a year to move to the next level
