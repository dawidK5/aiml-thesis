Customer: @AmazonHelp why do y’all disconnect while in cut when you’re in the wrong?

I’m so upset with your CS and would like to speak to a Supervisor

Agent: @325154 I hate that this happened.

Without providing personal info, can you tell us what's going on?

We'd like to help if we can.

Customer: @AmazonHelp Money was taken from my debit card for services I’ve never even used or received and now my money was put on another card?

Yea ok

Customer: @AmazonHelp How’d y’all take my money from one card but say you refunded it to a whole other card?

&amp; don’t feel I should be compensated  your mishap😔🙁

Agent: @325154 I'm sorry for the frustration so far.

When you spoke with us, what insight was provided for you?

^SJ

Customer: @AmazonHelp That I would have to locate where they “supposedly “ refunded it to.

Why charge my card but not refund my card?

Then just cut me off in chat

Agent: @325154 I'm so sorry for the poor experience.

We'd like another chance to look into it with you via phone: https://t.co/hApLpMlfHN ^WJ

Customer: @AmazonHelp I’ve tried that twice already!

What’s the next step for me to take on this matter?

Supervisor or management?

I have all the screenshots

Customer: @AmazonHelp And emails too

Agent: @325154 Reaching out via the link above would be the next step, so we can take care of it appropriately by phone.
