Customer: @SpotifyCares where is Red Velvet’s new Album :( Peek-A-Boo

Agent: @740998 Hey!

Fingers crossed we'll be able to have it soon, but there's info about Spotify content here: https://t.co/0i8GpimuDa /DF

Customer: @SpotifyCares Thanks!

I’ll do my best to wait!

Agent: @740998 No worries!

If you need anything else, just shout 🙂/DF

Customer: @SpotifyCares Also, I am from Holland and there is a special deal for Students, the price for premium month is 5 euro.

I pay 10 euro each month.

Can I change it?

And can I link my ideal for it?

Because they only accept Creditcard for it..

Agent: @740998 At the moment the student discount is not payable with iDeal, but we'll pass your feedback on that its something you'd like to see.

Sorry for any inconveniences /DF

Customer: @SpotifyCares It’s lowkey crazy, because Holland never pays with credit cards, everyone uses iDeal, most of them are students like me.

Agent: @740998 We can see how that’d be handy.

Thanks for taking the time to reach out – your feedback's been noted 📝 /DF
