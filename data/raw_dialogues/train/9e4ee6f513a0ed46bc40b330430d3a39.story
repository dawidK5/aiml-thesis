Customer: @VirginTrains devastated that I booked a ticket for the wrong time and now I have 9 hours to burn 😐

Agent: @367452 Oh no, that isn't good Dan, what will you do?

Customer: @VirginTrains Sit around in London for 9 hours I guess haha

Agent: @367452 Fair enough.

Customer: @VirginTrains Is there anyway you can get me home earlier?

Agent: @367452 What type of ticket do you have?

^PA

Customer: @VirginTrains I bought it in the virgin sale a couple of months ago but for the wrong time - the station said it would be an extra £70

Agent: @367452 Unfortunately that is the only way sorry.

Customer: @VirginTrains Great.

Agent: @367452 Really sorry.
