Customer: @AmazonHelp I googled the answer to find if I cancelled everything to start again, I'd be able to convey that I couldn't rtn that which hadn't been received.

However, it now appears original &amp; replacement are arriving today.

The saga continues

Agent: @415856 If you'd like to contact us phone or chat, we'd be more than happy to take a closer look at the order(s) with you and see if there's anything we can do to help: https://t.co/JzP7hlA23B

Customer: @AmazonHelp Amazon delivery has arrived.

Replacement order only.

Not the original order.

I've printed return slip for item that I don't have

Customer: @AmazonHelp Update.

Amazon has sent email acknowledging non delivery &amp; full refund.

Thanks for your help

Agent: @415856 You're welcome.

Glad we could help.

Reach out again if you have questions in the future.
