Customer: @121349 Hello, I want to ask which is the easiest way to arrive from Orly airport to Intercontinental Paris - Le Grand?

I will appreciate your answer, greetings!

Agent: @752353 1/2 Hi, the Orly Airport is 25 kms from the Intercontinental Paris - Le Grand.

You may take the Roissy Bus from the airport

Agent: @752353 2/2 which will take you about an hour or by taxi which will take about 50 minutes.

Hope this helps.
