3/3

Customer: @JetBlue I did.

They told me they couldn't even do food vouchers.

They offered me a bag of chips.

All I was hoping for was food &amp; maybe shuttle.

Customer: @JetBlue Not even food for hours.

Delays since 3 pm.

Kind of a fail to not even cover food with delay after delay, flight change, airport change...
