Customer: @Tesco Seriously first world problem, but can you try and encourage stores not to refrigerate red wine provided with the finest meal deal?

Customer: @Tesco Verging on resorting to this... probably not wise 🍷 https://t.co/0iI1fMz2QM

Customer: @Tesco This may be better, but still not ideal https://t.co/iZvFcSP3LN

Customer: @Tesco Will settle for the “bath in sink full of hot water” option but if it wasn’t refrigerated then it could all be avoided 😬 https://t.co/7OiKjiYxDb

Customer: @Tesco (seriously though @Tesco can you do something 😢)

Agent: @233806 Hi Joseph, I can understand your frustration and you're not alone.

We need to display all of the Meal Deal options together.

Agent: @233806 Since the other items need to be chilled then so does the wine (for display purposes).

I hope it came up to room temp quickly.

Customer: @Tesco I understand 👍🏼 @marksandspencer have a separate area for wine — another option would be to include the meal deal wine with the normal wine?

Agent: @233806 Could you please DM us your full name and e-mail?
