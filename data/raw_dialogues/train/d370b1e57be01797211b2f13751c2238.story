Customer: @marksandspencer when you get an email to say your order is ready and waiting 😁 then get told to go away because it is 11.45am and you can’t have it until 12pm 😡 said I could wait but was told it still may not be ready..... 😳

Agent: @286137 We're sorry to hear this, Gemma :( We do say orders can be collected from midday here https://t.co/RSemKK3V7I but can completely understand you being annoyed when you'd had an email.

Agent: @286137 Which store were you collecting from and did you manage to get your order before you let?

Customer: @marksandspencer Hello, it was the York Vangarde store, and no I went away empty handed as they said they couldn’t guarantee they would have scanned all parcels even if I waited an extra 15mins until 12pm...

I went back today and collected my parcel

Customer: @marksandspencer On balance, I went to the Harrogate store Sat 18th Nov and received amazing service from Jerome on the refund/ collection point.

He processed my refund, found my item to collect and even took away the extra packaging.

Very helpful ☺️☺️☺️

Agent: @286137 We've fed this back to our Store Manager, Gemma.

We're glad you have your parcel now but really sorry this wasn't sorted yesterday for you.

Agent: @286137 We've also been in touch with our Harrogate Store Manager to let them know what you've said about Jerome.

We'll make sure this gets back to him and he gets some well deserved recognition :) Thanks.

Customer: @marksandspencer No problem!

Thanks for following this up, could understand if it was 9am but as it was almost 12 it just seemed a bit harsh

Customer: @marksandspencer That’s great - thank you ☺️
