Customer: @O2 logic: new legislation means can use allowance abroad, something my contract charges me Â£5 a month for as part of contract 1/2

Agent: @124645 This was included in the tariff along with other services such as music streaming.

The price of your tariff cannot be changed.

Customer: @O2 My question is why I'm still paying it when it's now free by law?

Seems unfair to others that also on same tariff as myself.

Agent: @124645 The tariff agreed also included your minutes, texts, data and allowed you to have O2 Travel at no extra cost.

Customer: @O2 But it was advertised and sold as an extra Â£5 a month so Â£40 not Â£35.

So just wondering why I'm still paying it if this service is now free

Agent: @124645 Your tariff charge is for UK minutes, UK texts &amp; UK data.
