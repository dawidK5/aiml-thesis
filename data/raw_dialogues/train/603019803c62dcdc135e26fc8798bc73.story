Customer: @VerizonSupport My internet went out and it now says limited on my router has an orange light any way i can get help on how to fix or a number to call?

Agent: @819581 Have you reset the router?

Customer: @VerizonSupport 4 times

Agent: @819581 We can help!

Try a manual reboot.

Do so by unplugging the router and unscrewing the coax cable.

After 3mins, re-screw the coax cable and plug in the router.

This should help!

Let us know.

Customer: @VerizonSupport it didnâ€™t change ðŸ˜¢

Agent: @819581 Do you happen to know where your BBU is located for a reboot so the data port can be initialized?

It can sometimes be located in a garage or basement and can look like 1 of the 2 units.

Is there at least a power cable plugged into an outlet?
