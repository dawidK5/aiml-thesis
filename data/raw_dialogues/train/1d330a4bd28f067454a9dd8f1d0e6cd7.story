Customer: Its been 4-hours and I’m at 57% of the latest Microsoft update 💃🏻🤷🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️

Customer: Would it really kill @115890 @MicrosoftHelps to issue updates in smaller increments so they don’t take all day?...Some of us have jobs and lives we need to deal with.

Agent: @296265 Oh dear!

Let's get this sorted, Nani.

Which version of Windows are you using?

Please tell us more details about your concern.

Customer: @MicrosoftHelps Windows 10...Most recent update...Began around 10pm last night...Shutdown computer at 1am because I needed to sleep...Started up again at about 8am today...Finally got done (I hope) at 1:30pm this afternoon.

Customer: @MicrosoftHelps Just seems ridiculous that update should take this much time is my complaint.

Agent: @296265 Thank you for your response.

How fast updates install depends on various factors, such as your computer’s processing power, the speed of your Internet connection and the size of the update file.

Should you need further assistance, please let us know.

Customer: @MicrosoftHelps I appreciate the response and understand fully...I have a brand new computer, fairly fast internet...It was, as far as I could tell, one file that was updated...Must have been one huge file to take well over 5 hours.

Agent: @296265 Hi, Nani.

Has the update finished?

Just checking if you need further help.

Customer: @MicrosoftHelps After near 10 hours, it did finish updating...Thank you for checking in with me...So far no issues with the current update
