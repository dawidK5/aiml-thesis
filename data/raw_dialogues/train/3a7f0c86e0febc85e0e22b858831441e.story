Customer: @116029 Nobody can figure out how to turn my trial account into a paying biz advanced plan.

Maybe you can?

Agent: @293884 Hey Keith, thanks for checking with us - As long as you donâ€™t cancel your trial, it will automatically convert into an annual or monthly Business subscription (whatever you selected upon setting up your trial), so no need to worry about making any manual changes yourself... 1/2

Agent: @293884 ...during this time.

Hope this helps clarify!

Customer: @DropboxSupport I want to cancel my trial and upgrade to a full plan, since I need more storage.

:) I tried to do it through the portal and it wonâ€™t let me.

I even included screenshots in the Ticket #7288583, which hasnâ€™t got a reply since 4:12am yesterday.

Customer: @DropboxSupport Iâ€™d just love to get a response.. since its been over a day and I thought Biz support was quicker?

Agent: @293884 Hi again, we do understand how you feel.

Weâ€™ve prioritized the ticket to expedite matters for your benefit.

Customer: @DropboxSupport I finally just called support.. and theyâ€™re telling me they canâ€™t do anything and I have to wait out the 30 day trial.. thats crazy!

Iâ€™ve never heard of a company *refusing* to take my money like this.
