Customer: @115888 what's the deal with the weak random in playlists?

Keeps playing the same band consecutively - this has been happening forever now!

Agent: @533903 Hey!

We’ve made some improvements to our shuffle algorithm.

We’d love to hear your feedback here: https://t.co/T3vZnSL3od /RI

Customer: @SpotifyCares It's a little out dated

Agent: @533903 To clarify, does this happen when you're using Shuffle with Connect?

Customer: @SpotifyCares I try to shuffle in playlist and it really doesn't play randomly, plays the same artist almost continuously.

Don't know what connect is

Agent: @533903 We'll take note of that.

Can you let us know if you listen on your speakers or TV, using the Spotify app as a remote?

Customer: @SpotifyCares From my phone via Bluetooth connection.
