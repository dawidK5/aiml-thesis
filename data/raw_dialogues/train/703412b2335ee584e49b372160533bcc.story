Agent: @232333 Hi there.

Are you still having issues setting up Outlook 2016?

Can you provide more details about it?

Customer: @MicrosoftHelps I have a paid Office 365 subscription and it won‚Äôt accept my password for Gmail.

I have my email set for IMAP but no luck.

Agent: @232333 Just to clarify, are you using Office 365 Business or Personal?

Customer: @MicrosoftHelps Personal

Agent: @232333 Thank you for this information.

Do you have any anti virus installed to your device?

Are you getting an error message when setting up Outlook 2016?

Customer: @MicrosoftHelps No.

Just Win Defender and no errors.

Just a pop up box from Win Security with the username and password

Agent: @232333 You may just try to retype the username and password.

Have you updated your password?

Could you also send us a screenshot so we can further check if possible?

Agent: @232333 Hello there.
