@Tesco used to do a box of chocolate orange segments that I'd use for baking!

Much cheaper than Terrys.

Have you discontinued them?

I can't find them at my local Extra anymore??

If so I have good news  for you!

Our Andover Extra on River Way still sells these :).

Customer: @Tesco I mean the cooked ones you can buy over the hot counter!

They're delish and a nice quick lunch for when I'm busy rushing around shopping!

Agent: @228258 Oh...well in that case I have some bad news for you.

We've stopped selling them in the Andover store however if you DM me your name and address I'll log your interest in bringing this item back :).
