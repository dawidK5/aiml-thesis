Customer: I’ve had @116035 since I was 17 years old now they’re changing my account so I have to pay a monthly fee starting in January 😒.

Might be time to say goodbye, homegirl doesn’t make enough for that nonsense.

I liked my e-checking 😢.

Agent: @790337 We stopped selling eBanking in 2013.

Digital banking services are now an integral part of all our checking products.

Agent: @790337  Please visit https://t.co/Zyg1vuhAoR to learn about balance requirements &amp; ways to avoid fees.

Customer: @BofA_Help I don’t make enough with direct deposit to avoid your fees 😒, I’ve already called and talked a representative, I’ll be going somewhere different come January.

I liked e-checking because I never go in the bank anyway, but I’ll find a new bank 🤷🏼‍♀️.

Agent: @790337 We apologize for the inconvenience, please keep us posted if you need anything.

Customer: @BofA_Help There’s really nothing you can do unless you change the requirements to waive the fee each month.

I won’t be making the minimum deposit amount in order to do so until after I graduate.

Agent: @790337 Hi Mallory, in order to waive the monthly maintenance fee, one of the requirements would need to be met.

Customer: @BofA_Help You’re charging my account because I don’t make enough money to meet the requirements, doesn’t make much sense.

I loved BoA for the time I had it and recommended it to many people, but at this point I need to weigh my options.

Customer: @BofA_Help The monthly fee may be small but that’s a weeks worth of gas.

Agent: @790337 We’d like to talk with you.
