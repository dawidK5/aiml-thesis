Customer: @British_Airways Good morning.

When did your policy on carrying guitars on board change?

Agent: @451309 Hi Antonio, what part of our policy for travelling with a musical instrument are you referring to?

^L

Customer: @British_Airways That guitars must be in a hard case and checked into the hold.

I was informed at check in.

I wish I’d been informed before travelling.

Agent: @451309 Hi Antonio, did you contact us before travelling to let us know you would be carrying a guitar on your travels?

We're sorry for any

Agent: @451309 inconvenience this has caused you.

We will try and make room in the cabin when possible but this cannot be guaranteed.

2/2 ^L

Customer: @British_Airways Well, it’s just never been policy before — as far as I know — that guitars are outright not permitted in the cabin.

Customer: @British_Airways If I bring a guitar in a soft case (so that it can be stowed in an overhead) and it is checked, there’s a high damage risk in the hold 2/4

Customer: @British_Airways It’s a catch 22, and it makes me worry if I can travel on BA with a guitar for work, as I need the instrument intact at the other end 😕 4/4

Agent: @451309 Hi Antonio, we understand your concerns.

As previously advised, we will try and allow it to be stored in the cabin but it cannot

Agent: @451309 be guaranteed.

We've passed on your comments for consideration next time this policy is reviewed.

2/2 ^L

Customer: @British_Airways Thanks.

I’ve been on E170s where the ground crew have said, “The flight’s full, no way it’ll fit”, then there’s been a dozen empty overheads

Agent: @451309 Hi Antonio, this is disappointing to hear.

We understand how important it is to keep musical instruments safe during travel and we'll

Agent: @451309 do all we can to make sure all our staff are fully trained on this this and understand when to make allowances.
