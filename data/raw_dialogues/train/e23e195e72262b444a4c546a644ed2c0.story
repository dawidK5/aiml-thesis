Customer: I AM SICK TO FUCKING DEATH OF HAVING MONEY TROUBLES, Iâ€™M 21 YEARS OLD AND DO NOTHING BUT CRY OVER MONEY, FUCK THE FUCK OFF!

!

Customer: Iâ€™m very angry, also tesco keeps rising the cost of their products and thinks we wonâ€™t notice???

@Tesco youâ€™re slowly ruining my life by upping costs by 1p, 5p and 10p at a steady pace, u ainâ€™t slick I see ya doing it.

Agent: @232859 Hi Coleen, I am very sorry to hear this!

we really do try to take the hit when our suppliers raise their prices so as to not impact our customers too much but unfortunately some small increase inevitably falls on to the price!

Agent: @232859 Can I ask if there are any particular items you are referring to so that I can log this for review?

If so please do feel free to let me know!

Kind regards - Martin 2/2

Customer: @Tesco itâ€™s your tesco own branded items youâ€™re increasing!

me and my partner do online food orders with you and have done happily for months; prior to around 2 months ago until now weâ€™ve noticed you increasing prices from 5p to 20p on your tesco branded items- very disappointing

Agent: @232859 Hi there, can you let me know which items in particular are increasing?

I can look into this further for you.

Thanks - Gemma.

Customer: @Tesco will you be doing anything about the matter?

I was expecting a bit of a better response than just logging what I said instead of explaining why youâ€™re doing it and resolving it
