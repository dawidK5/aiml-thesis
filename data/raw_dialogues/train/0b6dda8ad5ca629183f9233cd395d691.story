Customer: When you have been waiting 3+ hours for a maintenance crew from another airport 🙄 @AmericanAir

Customer: @AmericanAir Hands down THE worst airline experience I’ve ever had.

Agent: @290418 We'd like to check on an update for you.

What's the flight number?

Customer: @AmericanAir 4412.

It’s been pushed back about 4 times now, so I don’t know how much of an “update” there will be.

Agent: @290418 Our latest is showing an estimated departure time of 7p.

We also have a great link to keep an eye on it here: https://t.co/hSJ3SkyGEd

Customer: @AmericanAir We’re not even boarding yet.

Still no crew.

Ridiculous.

Customer: @AmericanAir Now 7:35
