Agent: @380763 Oh no!

Which device do you use?

Noticing this w/a certain channel?

For now, try a quick reboot of your device+modem/router.

Customer: @hulu_support chromecast from Android.

Agent: @380763 Got it.

Please try: https://t.co/ckdg70q5uc --particularly power cycling your equipment.

Is there any improvement after?

Customer: @hulu_support actually, yes there seems to be!

Thanks!

Agent: @380763 We're glad to hear it!

If we can ever help with anything else, we're just a tweet away!
