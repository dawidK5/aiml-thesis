Customer: #TuesdayThoughts -when you walk into @116827 &amp; the person working the floor asks if you “have a transaction today” 🤔😆😳 #Gr8MarketingPlan

Let me know if you need me to look into something for you.

I'm here to help.

Customer: @Ask_WellsFargo I just do not understand this vending machine language at all.

Super creepy

Customer: @Ask_WellsFargo 4 years I’ve avoided walking into your bank b/c somebody runs up to me &amp; asks if I have a transaction.

Ummm... NO, I’m here 4 the brownies!

Agent: @619843 We appreciate the feedback, Jen.

Did you visit a specific branch?

If so, provide the address so I can share this properly.

Customer: @Ask_WellsFargo happens at every branch...vending machine lingo.

No one wants somebody coming up 2 them at the bank 2 ask if they have a transaction.
