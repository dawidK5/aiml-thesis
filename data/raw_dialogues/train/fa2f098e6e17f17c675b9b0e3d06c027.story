Customer: @Delta Thank you.

The staff I spoke with was wonderful.

Its the urgency 2 back away from gate, 2 meet bloated KPIs, caused heartbreak.

Customer: @Delta WHAT!?

Read the convo history.

D staff, great to work with &amp; I think they tried 2 help, but my problem wasnt solved &amp; was caused by Delta.

Customer: @Delta I would have been able to celebrate my father's 70th w him, if Delta had any forward thinking and didnt try to meet inflated departure KPIs.

Customer: @Delta A day spent at the Detroit airport in tears &amp; depression isnt how flying should B.

Happy Birthday dad, Im sorry I couldnt spend it with you

Agent: @371196 I understand your disappointment.

Disruptions to travel plans are frustrating especially when you're traveling for a special event.
