Customer: @O2 hi.

Any way anyone can tell me whether my iPhone X will be delivered on Friday and if not when I might expect it?

Agent: @123610 Hi Simon, did you pre-order online?

If so, it'll be delivered in the timescale showing when you pre-ordered.

Customer: @O2 Yes I ordered online and I donâ€™t remember there being any timescale shown apart from the launch date.

I have DM you the order number

Customer: @O2 Is there any way anyone can check for me?

Iâ€™m guessing Fridays deliveries must have been allocated so can be checked?

Customer: @O2 Iâ€™m guessing from the lack of response, no one knows

Agent: @123610 We've replied to your private message Simon.

Customer: @O2 Yes but only telling me that once youâ€™ve sent my phone youâ€™ll then tell me youâ€™ve sent it.

Thatâ€™s not really what I was asking or particularly helpful.

Agent: @123610 That's all the information we have Simon.

Customer: @O2 Okay.

Thanks for trying.

It must be frustrating for you guys as well not being given any details to be able to pass on.
