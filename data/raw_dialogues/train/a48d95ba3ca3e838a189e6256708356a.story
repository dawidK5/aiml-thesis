Customer: @VirginTrains 16:43 from Euston to Edinburgh.

Seriously guys turn down the a/c in the quiet carriage 'G'.

Agent: @267523 Hi Jasmine, please speak to the onboard team and they should be able to adjust the temperature for you ^HP

Customer: @VirginTrains Not worth risking my seat as I was stood up from Bham to Euston this morning and seat reservations aren't showing on here atm.

Agent: @267523 The team should be making their way through during the journey ^HP

Customer: @VirginTrains Not so far ☹️ I'm off in half an hour.

Quiet coach = less hot air 😂

Agent: @267523 Apologies Jasmin, we hope it cools down onboard for you ^HP

Customer: @VirginTrains Also late so I've missed my connection 😡😡😡

Agent: @267523 Sorry to hear this, Jasmin.

Please speak to station staff who will be able to validate your ticket for the next service for you ^HP
