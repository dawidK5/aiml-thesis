Customer: @115830 the headphones I have just brought now have £10 off just one day later.

Is there anything you can do about this?

Agent: @146432 Hi Gavin.

Has the order already dispatched?

^DC

Customer: @AmazonHelp Yep, just awaiting for delivery today.

Any chance of a £10 gift voucher?

Customer: @AmazonHelp @AmazonHelp Also would you be able to tell me if my package will arrive before 8pm as my work will be closed at 6pm

Agent: @146432 Hi Gavin.

We wouldn't be able to specify a delivery time I'm afraid.

Is the order being delivered to your work address?

^DC

Customer: @AmazonHelp Yes its being delivered to my work address.

I just thought it would be out for delivery by now

Agent: @146432 Hi Gavin, that's great.

We deliver up until 5pm to work addresses so we still have lots of time to get this to you today.

Customer: @AmazonHelp Perfect sorry I know you’re busy today 🐝🐝🐝

Customer: @AmazonHelp Any chance on a gift card for the £10 difference cosidering it was only yesterday?

Agent: @146432 Sorry Gavin, we don't offer price match so we would't be able to issue any refunds.^MA
