Customer: @Delta I also MUST have my luggage with me as I will be leaving in the am via Naval carrier (#Nimitz)

Agent: @790984 I can get you on a flight with AS to Seattle, where you can connect to the rest of your flights.

To reroute your luggage, it would be best to speak with an agent at the airport.
