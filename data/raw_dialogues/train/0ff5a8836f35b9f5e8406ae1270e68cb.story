Customer: Why doesn't @115888's web player ever work when I want it too

Agent: @317564 Hey Kayla!

Can you tell us more about what's happening exactly?

We'll see what we can suggest /NS

Customer: @SpotifyCares Everything else works, it's just that the music won't play.

Agent: @317564 Got it.

Are you getting any specific error messages?

A screenshot would come in handy /NS

Customer: @SpotifyCares Nope, nothing.

Agent: @317564 We appreciate the heads-up.

Just to check, what operating system do you have installed on your computer?

/MT

Customer: @SpotifyCares Of course!

It's Chrome OS.

Agent: @317564 Got it.

Could you try clearing your browser's cookies/cache?

We'd also suggest using an incognito/private window /MT

Customer: @SpotifyCares Just did both of those, and it still doesn't play.

It worked fine yesterday.

Agent: @317564 Hmm, that's odd.

Can you try restarting your router?

We'd also recommend trying different WiFi connections /MT

Customer: @SpotifyCares Restarted it twice already and still nothing.

Usually that tends to work.

I have no other WiFi connections to connect too.

Agent: @317564 Could you DM us your account's email address or username?

We'll take a look backstage /MT https://t.co/ldFdZR1cbT
