Customer: @comcastcares That would have been nice to know!

I was told someone will contact me by the 1st.

Still nothing has happened to fix the tree limb

Agent: @423503 Tree limbs are not something we fix as we do not trim trees.

We only tend to the lines.

Is the limb still resting on it?

Customer: @comcastcares Yes tree limb still resting on the wire.

Agent: @423503 Thank you for the pic.

Tech ops is going out to look at this to determine if this is a service line or main line and what to do with it.

Thanks for all your help.

Glad we could get you an answer about the line and who to contact.
