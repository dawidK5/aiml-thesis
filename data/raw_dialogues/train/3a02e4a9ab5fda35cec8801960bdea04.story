Customer: @AppleSupport help pls when I sync new music from iTunes to my phone it changes to the wrong artwork all the time😩😩😩

Agent: @342358 We'd be happy to look into what's going on.

Does this happen with every album?

Customer: @AppleSupport Yes!

It changes to a random artwork but in itunes looks ok, it changes only in the iphone when I sync them

Agent: @342358 Are you an Apple Music subscriber?

Customer: @AppleSupport No, it happens with the music i have in my pc’s library

Agent: @342358 Is the artwork on your PC custom, or is it the artwork that should appear?

Same with the artwork as it appears on your iPhone.

Customer: @AppleSupport Is the artwork that should appear, the one that comes with the mp3 file

Agent: @342358 Thanks for clarifying.
