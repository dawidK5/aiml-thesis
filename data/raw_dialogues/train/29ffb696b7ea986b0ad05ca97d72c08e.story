Customer: @Tesco had problem after problem trying to set up my Clubcard app still not getting anywhere!

ðŸ˜¡as a member of staff is like to say I use it!

Agent: @319730 Not good, so sorry Sarah.

What seems to be the issue?

Do you get an error message?

Thanks - Leighton

Customer: @Tesco It won't let me sign in or register as it says I'm already registered but I haven't done it on this before?

Agent: @319730 Have you tried signing in?
