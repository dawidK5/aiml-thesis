Customer: @AmazonHelp Ok !

But what if i didnâ€™t like the product and want to return it

Agent: @264322 We wouldn't be able to accept the remorse returns.

Appreciate your understanding.

Customer: @AmazonHelp Ok thanks !

But these are earphones so does it mean same policy apply for these as well
