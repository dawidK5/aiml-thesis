Customer: @AskAmex I haven't got my Amex Hilton Surpass sign-up bonus 3 months after meeting the spending requirement.

Agent: @385119 Good morning Bin, thx for tweeting us.

Oh No!

Have you escalated your concern to a supervisor?

Customer: @AskAmex I chatted with Amex Customer service 3 times on this, and I was asked to wait for another 6-8 weeks... this is unbelievable.

Agent: @385119 I would be happy to investigate.

Do you have time to chat securely through our website so I can see your account?

^RK

Customer: @AskAmex Yes I can do it.

But how do I reach you on Amex chat?

Agent: @385119 Has the allotted time frame of 6-8weeks passed since you met the spend threshold?

Agent: @385119 Do you have time to secure chat with me?
