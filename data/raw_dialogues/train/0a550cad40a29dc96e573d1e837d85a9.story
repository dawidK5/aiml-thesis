Customer: @116245 can you check order FT287235 for me.

I purchased the Paw Patrol monkey temple on this order and it said in stock but it doesn’t seem to be on the actual order for some reason?

But you’ve taken my money?

Please make sure the item is on the order for when I collect

Agent: @270801 Hi I am sorry but this item has been cancelled and refunded due to no stock available.

~ Catherine

Customer: @ArgosHelpers How can you sell me it though, I want the whole thing cancelling then as I’m travelling to get that item.

You can’t sell me an item that’s clearly not in stock.

What a joke.

Either cancel my order or source me the item by Thursday or a complaint will be going in

Agent: @270801 Hi, I can only apologise for the inconvenience this has caused the other 2 items 
are available for collection, I am unable to source you the paw partol item as this is out of stock, and has been refunded back to your PayPal account.

Customer: @ArgosHelpers That’s no good to me though, you’ve sold me the item at that price.

It’s not my fault you then can’t source it.

You’ve agreed to sell me the item and a simple refund is not acceptable.

Please arrange a manager to call me ASAP to discuss this.

Agent: @270801 I am sorry but managers have no access to live chat please call 03456402020 to speak with a manager.

Customer: @ArgosHelpers Tell them to expect my call.

You’ve misled me, I won’t use Argos ever again.

How can you think this is ok?

You will find me one I can assure you of that!

Who tells my kid they can’t have this item now?

I bet you won’t.

Customer: @ArgosHelpers Apparently you have no managers 😂 what a joke.

Get me a manager!!

!

Customer: @ArgosHelpers Stop ignoring me!

I’m going nowhere until I have my item

Agent: @270801 Hi Tom, I am sorry about this, I have sent your chats through to one of our Managers.

Jan

Customer: @ArgosHelpers So they do exist?

You might wanna give “Luke” a nudge to remind him.

Tell him to improve his attitude while you’re at it

Customer: @ArgosHelpers Do you have any idea when the manager will have time to respond to me?
