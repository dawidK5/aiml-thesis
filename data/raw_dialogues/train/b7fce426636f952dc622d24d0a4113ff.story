Customer: @SpotifyCares hi, Spotify isn’t set on offline but every time I’m not on WiFi it says “Spotify is offline” but my data is activate

Agent: @422419 Hey Camille, that doesn't sound right.

What device, operating system, and version of Spotify is this happening on?

We'll lend a hand /SY

Customer: @SpotifyCares iPhone 6, iOS 11.0.3 https://t.co/LjBrzL9HVr

Agent: @422419 1: Thanks!

Just to check, are you only getting the issue when you're on 3G/4G?

Agent: @422419 2: If you're getting any error messages, can you send us a screenshot for us to check?

/SY

Customer: @SpotifyCares Yes, when I’m on WiFi it’s working

Customer: @SpotifyCares I’m not on WiFi but on 4g so it should work https://t.co/hWtazjnw2f
