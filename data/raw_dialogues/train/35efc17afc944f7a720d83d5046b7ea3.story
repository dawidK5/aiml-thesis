Customer: Oh no @Tesco please tell us you’re not discontinuing your guinea pig muesli?

We won’t eat anything else &amp; will starve!😥

Agent: @220298 Hi there, I'm having trouble finding this product, do you have the product packaging?

If so can you please DM a clear photo of it?

TY - Mark

Customer: @Tesco We’re having technical problems with DM so here’s a photo (with added piggy).

Agent: @220298 Hi there :) I'm afraid the Guinea Pig Food Muesli has been removed from our range :(  1/2

Agent: @220298 We do stock these https://t.co/uSn85YgFTr I know this isn't the same so hopefully this isn't too disappointing for the gang!

Customer: @Tesco Oh no, this is very bad news for us piggies, we don’t like nuggets &amp; refuse to eat them😔

Agent: @220298 Hi There, I'm really sorry about this.

Maybe you could mix the Tesco Guinea Pig Nuggets with something else that they enjoy?

1/2

Agent: @220298 I do with with my rabbits and they seem to love it.

Otherwise I do hope that you can find an alternative product.

Thanks, Jessica :)

Customer: @Tesco We’ll research different muesli, last time we tried to mix food they picked out the bits they liked &amp; left the nuggets!

Hugs to your rabbit🐰

Agent: @220298 I hope that you find the right mix - Laura :)
