Customer: @GWRHelp assuming the 16:03 Bristol Parkway - London Paddington can’t be held??

On the delayed 15:41 BTM - Parkway, currently due into parkway 11 mins late at 16:03

Customer: @GWRHelp Never mind, getting more &amp; more delayed now.

Seriously hate the trains.

Given myself 2 hours spare to get to my final destination &amp; now looking unlikely that’ll be enough time.

Agent: @148014 Hi Natasha.

Sorry for the delay.

The 15:41 service was delayed due to following a late running preceding service.

Apologies for the problems this has caused.

The next train to London Paddington us at 16:33.

Customer: @GWRHelp Ok, so due into London 40 mins later than planned (assuming we aren’t delayed further...🙃), as the 16:33 takes 10 mins longer than the 16:03.

At what point does this journey qualify for a refund (partial or otherwise)?

So stressed.

Agent: @148014 If delayed by an hour on that journey you can claim compensation.

Customer: @GWRHelp Beginning to look likely.

Any idea when the signal problems will be fixed - currently stuck at didcot parkway with no departure est.

Signal issues are so common in this area I’ve lost track of how often I’ve been delayed here.

Agent: @148014 That service is currently expected to reach Paddington at 18:37.

Apologies again for the delay.

Lewis

Customer: @GWRHelp Finally arrived nearly 1hr 30mins late due to delays.

Assume I can’t claim as the delays were split on 2 trains?

Going to miss the first half of the show I’m due to see.

Overall a great Friday 🙁

Agent: @148014 Hi Natasha.

Really sorry for this.

Including train times what full journey did you make please?
