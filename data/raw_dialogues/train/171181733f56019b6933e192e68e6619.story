Customer: @sainsburys I paid by card but spent about Â£40 in there so not just the 1 item?

Agent: @297065 If you return with your bank statement, showing the transaction, this will also act as proof of purchase.

Customer: @sainsburys Ok - thanks but do I need the packaging as that's binned?

Agent: @297065 ...They will be able to advise you further.

Thanks, Karen 2/2

Customer: @sainsburys I took it and they said that I needed the packaging and receipt.
