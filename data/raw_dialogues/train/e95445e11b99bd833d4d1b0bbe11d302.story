Customer: @AirAsiaSupport Hi team, need your help changing a flight.

Instead of HKG &gt; BKI return it now needs to be MEL &gt; BKI &gt; HKG.

Can you help?

Sorry but Route Change is strictly not allowed.

Only Flight Change date/time is possible.Thank you- Mariya

Agent: @716229 Hi Adam, You still can use return flight leg BKI-HKG even you no show for outbound flight

Agent: @716229 and it wont effected another 2 guest in this booking.

Customer: @AirAsiaSupport Thanks Mariya, is there anywhere on your website that refers to this in case I have any issues at the airport?

Agent: @716229 No worries.

As this is not a Fly thru / connecting flight.

Your return flight wont be forfeited
