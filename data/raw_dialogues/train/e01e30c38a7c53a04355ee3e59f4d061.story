Customer: @Delta Thank you for the reply.

I wont spend double to sit next to her on the exact same flight.

Agent: @303343 I understand, Hillary.

You may want to check different dates to see if the fare maybe lower  *HML

Agent: @303343 if your friend hasn't already booked her flight.

Customer: @Delta Unfortunately she has since her side was more complex with the layover.

Guess she is going to Nicaragua for her 30th alone ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜­
