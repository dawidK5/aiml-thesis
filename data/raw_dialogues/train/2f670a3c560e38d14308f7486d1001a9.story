Customer: @Delta - Come on #Delta ... of all days to have delays..... not today 🙏🏼

Agent: @285507 Hey, Robert.

At this time, all of your flights are showing on time.

Sometimes information comes down sooner at the airport though.

Were you informed of a delay at the gate?

*ASK

Customer: @Delta Yes, for a 15 minute delay 45 minutes ago

Customer: @Delta DL 5733 and I cannot miss my shuttle to my families house

Agent: @285507 Can you please DM me your confirmation number, so I can further assist you?

Customer: @Delta Sent

Agent: @285507 Hi Robert!

I am so sorry to hear about your delay.

We will have you on your way very soon.

Customer: @Delta Believe it or not, that generic apology doesn’t fix or help anything.

I have been getting the same one (apology) for 3 years now

Agent: @285507 We appreciate your constructive feedback and we are grateful you've taken the time to share.

It helps us to be better.

I see the flight has landed into LAX.

If further assistance is needed, please let us know.
