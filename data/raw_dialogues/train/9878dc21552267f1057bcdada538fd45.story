Customer: @AppleSupport why does my music keep pausing every time I go in another app?

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m running iOS 11.1

Agent: @316439 We're here for you.

Are you using the default Music app or something else?

Also, does this happen without headphones?

Customer: @AppleSupport It happen with headphones on, and yes Iâ€™m using the default music app

Agent: @316439 Do you experience the same issue without headphones?

Customer: @AppleSupport Without headphones it doesnâ€™t happen.

Agent: @316439 Thanks for clarifying this for us.

Do the apps that you're opening have audio available that could be played?

Customer: @AppleSupport When I open snapchat my music stops, then it starts to play again when Iâ€™m using my ðŸŽ§â€™s, when Iâ€™m not with ðŸŽ§â€™s on it plays.

Agent: @316439 Try deleting the Snapchat app, restarting the device, then reinstalling the app.

Please send us a DM with the result.
