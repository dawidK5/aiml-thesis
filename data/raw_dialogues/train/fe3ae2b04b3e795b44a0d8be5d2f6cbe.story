Customer: Hey @115888 I can't play any song by @2235 in the app.

OP5.

I have already un installed and deleted the cache.

Agent: @352349 Hey Jorge!

That doesn't sound good.

Just to check, are you getting any error messages?

A screenshot can be handy /AU

Customer: @SpotifyCares Not really, I click on a song and it just stays stuck.

If I'm playing another song it stops and nothing plays afterwards.

Agent: @352349 Can you try restarting your device, then log out and back in?

While you're at it, what Android and Spotify versions are you using?

/AU

Customer: @SpotifyCares I have already restarted and logged out and it didn't work.

The android version is 7.1.1 and the app version is 8.4.22.857.

Agent: @352349 Hmm.

Is this only happening via 3G/4G, or is it the same with WiFi?

Keep us posted /NY

Customer: @SpotifyCares It is the same with 4G and with wifi.

Agent: @352349 Got it.

Does restarting your connection help at all?

Also, are you getting the same result when you try using a different device?

/NY

Customer: @SpotifyCares Restarting the connection didn't help.

I tried it on my laptop and the songs are playing there.

Agent: @352349 Thanks for the info.

Best thing to try here is a reinstall.

Just follow the steps at https://t.co/EqisDMwZAT.

Customer: @SpotifyCares Hi, I just updated the app version in my laptop and the songs are not playing there anymore.

It says: The song is not available.

If you have the file on your computer you can import it.

I am paying premium by the way.

Agent: @352349 Thanks for giving it a try.

Can you DM us your account's email address or username?
