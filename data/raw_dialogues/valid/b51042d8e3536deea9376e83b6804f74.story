Agent: @267277 Hi there, that's great to hear!

Could you DM me with the name or a description of this colleague so I can pass your great feedback on to the store's management team?

Thanks - Dafydd https://t.co/py5Z991Bme

Customer: @Tesco Done!

Agent: @267277 Thanks for replying!

Can I ask if this was the Poole Fleets Corner Extra on Waterloo Road, or Poole Extra on Yarrow Road?

Thanks - Struan :)

Customer: @Tesco I called the store and found him.

Apparently he's called M Champion: Champion by name, Champion by nature ‚ú®

Agent: @267277 Hi there.

I just found the store too.

I'm so glad you called the store and could let them know how amazing he was yourself.

I've also logged it on our system so it'll definitely get fed back to him.

:) TY- Charlotte

Customer: @Tesco Ah, good people deserve good feedback.

Thank you.

Agent: @267277 Hi there, definitely!

I believe everybody needs some recognition when doing a great job.

Thank you - Brooke
