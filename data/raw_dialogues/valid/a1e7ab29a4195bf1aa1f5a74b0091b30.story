Customer: Hey @115777 it would be nice if when I minimized Creative Cloud @117341 upon opening the app, it stayed minimized #ProductFeedback

Agent: @357513 Hi Joe,
 Did you try clicking the 3 dots by your profile pic in the CC desktop app &amp; select Pin to menu bar?

That should help you.

Customer: @AdobeCare Please provide a screenshot

Agent: @357513 Hi Joe, I attached a screen shot of my CC desktop app to show you where the Pin to menu bar is located.
