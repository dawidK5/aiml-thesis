Customer: Disgusted at high numbers of people without kids using parent &amp; child spaces at @sainsburys Crayford.

It needs better oversight please.

Agent: @379392 ... on the honesty and integrity of our customers.

Thanks, Karen 2/2

Customer: @sainsburys Not quite true.

The car park is meant to be patrolled with charges for those abusing the system.

Never seen it patrolled, when is this done?

Agent: @379392 I'm afraid the store is now closed, but I've emailed your feedback on to the Store Manager to be reviewed.

Thanks, Naomi.

Customer: @sainsburys Grateful if you could let me know the outcome of the store manager's review of my feedback.

Thanks.

Agent: @379392 Hi there, unfortunately we can't give out any updates on these matters.

However I can have the Store Manager give you a ... 1/2

Agent: @379392 ... call to discuss this further if you'd like?

Customer: @sainsburys I guess that means my feedback was filed in the bin.

I'd like a written response please.

Agent: @379392 Hi there, I would like to assure you that we take all customer feedback seriously and it will not go unnoticed.

Chris.

Customer: @sainsburys That's good to hear.

So when will I get a written response?

Thanks very much!

Agent: @379392 I'm afraid this isn't something that we'd get a written response out for.

The car park is owned by horizon and is monitored by CCTV by...1/3
