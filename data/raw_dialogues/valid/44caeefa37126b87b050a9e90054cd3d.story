Customer: @115858 @AppleSupport I’ve never been so disappointed in an update.

This IOS is trash constantly disconnecting my phone from Bluetooth ...

Agent: @753610 We want to help.

Which version of iOS 11 is installed on your iPhone?

You'll see this in Settings &gt; General &gt; About.

Customer: @AppleSupport 11.0.3

Agent: @753610 Let's have you delete the Bluetooth profile from both devices then pair them again together.

Then, test the new pairing.

Customer: @AppleSupport Give it a shot when I get the chance

Agent: @753610 Thank you.

Yes, please do keep us in the loop.

Customer: @AppleSupport Alleviated the problem of stopping the music for minutes at a time but if I change the volume it always plays the garbage U2 music...

Customer: @AppleSupport This update is trash, they’re only done to older phones so it forces you to lose your patience and spend stupid money on the same thing
