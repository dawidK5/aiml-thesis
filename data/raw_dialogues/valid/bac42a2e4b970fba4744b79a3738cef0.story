Customer: And then tell me I'll save 200 by going through US Cellular to get it fixed... how about I pay nothing and cancel my device protection too?

Agent: @223973 Hell Jesca.

Is there anything we can help with today?

Customer: @USCellularCares Nope.

Just going to chill with my broken phone for 2 years because I'm not paying to fix it when I already pay for device protection every month.

Agent: @223973 What happened to your phone?

^KJ

Customer: @USCellularCares The screen cracked in the lower left corner.

Agent: @223973 Which phone do you have?

^KJ

Customer: @USCellularCares Samsung galaxy s8 and I already went in to my local store to ask my options and I don't have $175 to fix it.

Agent: @223973 Do you have any lines on your account that are eligible to upgrade?

^KJ

Customer: @USCellularCares No.

I have a single plan and I just got this phone in June

Agent: @223973 In this case, filing a claim through Device Protection would be the cheapest option for replacing the phone.

Is the screen still functional?

^KJ

Customer: @USCellularCares Yeah it's just going to stay broken because device protection will cost 175 dollars that I don't have.
