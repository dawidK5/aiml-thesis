Customer: @116076 Store 3752 changed the delivery policy to have a minimum of $11.

Now I can't redeem my rewards without buying extraneous items to meet the minimum.

I used to order from you guys on a weekly basis.

I will be sticking to Dominos from here on out.

Thanks for your loyalty

Agent: @808286 We're sorry about this!

Please DM us your contact info and we can forward your concerns.

Thanks!

Customer: @AskPapaJohns Forward my concerns to whom?

I already talked to the manager of the store and he redirected me to customer service.

I waited on the line for approximately five minutes before I hung up.

Agent: @808286 We would be forwarding this to the store operators who over see this location.

We're sorry about this.

Customer: @AskPapaJohns "Would be"?

What does that mean?

Agent: @808286 We plan to forward your concerns to the store operators who over see this location.

These operators over see changes like the minimum delivery amount.

Feel free to DM us your contact info and we can inform the operators that you are not happy with this.

Thanks,

Customer: @AskPapaJohns I want you as a company to make sure that loyal customers are allowed to redeem their awards without penalty.

I attached a picture of all the pizzas that I ordered in the last 2 weeks and one of which I ordered today.
