Customer: @115722 what is going on with #SNF being frozen for the last 30 minutes.

All other channels are working and I’m missing the game because of #Fios being messed up.

Agent: @673907 Good evening, is this happening on all boxes?

^RMD

Customer: @VerizonSupport It was happening on both boxes in the house.

Yes.

Agent: @673907 We would want to reseat the coax cable at the main DVR and the splitter.

Can you take that coax out and then put it back in securely?

^BCW

Customer: @VerizonSupport But it’s only that one channel.

All other channels are working fine

Customer: @VerizonSupport Coax in main box taken out and put back in.

Still frozen

Agent: @673907 That's fine.

We will still would need to reseat coax and unplug the power cord.

^CAR

Customer: @VerizonSupport Power reset it.

Agent: @673907 Ok great we are happy to hear that!

Have a great day!
