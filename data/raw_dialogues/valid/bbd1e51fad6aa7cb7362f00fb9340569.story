Customer: @AskAmex  When is interest charged on Charge Cards with Pay Over Time, Sign and Travel, etc.

From the Due Date or from the Closing Date?

Agent: @401031 Hi there, thx for tweeting us.

That's a great Q!

Card Members can avoid paying interest by paying the Account Total

Agent: @401031 New Balance (the Pay in Full   Pay Over Time balances) in full by the Payment Due Date each month.

Agent: @401031 The exception to this is charges transferred by the Card Member using the Select &amp; Pay Later feature.

Agent: @401031 Select &amp; Pay Later charges start to accrue interest on the date the Card Member transfers the charge to the Pay Over Time balance.

Agent: @401031 Hope this helps.
