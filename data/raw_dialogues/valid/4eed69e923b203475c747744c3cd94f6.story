Customer: @GWRHelp Any news on what happened to the 9.13am from Lawrence Hill to Bristol Parkway?

It was delayed, now it appears to have disappeared.

Agent: @721962 Hi there.

There were animals on the line so the train had to bypass the station at a reduce speed so it could stop and investigate the damage to the service  - Josh

Customer: @GWRHelp Okay.

Why was this not communicated?

Customer: @GWRHelp Another train has just passed us, going to Parkway.

Surely not too much to have it stop at LH?

Customer: @GWRHelp No apology either?

Agent: @721962 Apologies for any lack of information provided, I appreciate this must be frustrating.

Services are not always able to stop additionally as this can cause further delays for other train - Josh

Customer: @GWRHelp As opposed to the forty minutes I have now wasted sat on a platform?

For a train that was supposed to be coming until it disappeared 3 minutes before on the live planner?

How do I formally complain?

Agent: @721962 Sorry for the inconvenience Greig.

We always try to impact as few customers as possible.
