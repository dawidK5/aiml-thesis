Customer: @115725 Really disappointing service.

After weeks dealing w/ wrong accusations, my bill is higher b/c of Verizon’s mistake.

Agent: @651141 What mistake was made?

We would like to help.

Customer: @VerizonSupport Our phone stopped working.

We called and were told it was because we had told another company to claim it.

We hadn’t.

Customer: @VerizonSupport The problem is Verizon then said our contract was broken, and so our bill went up.

Now we’re paying more monthly for something we didn’t do.

Agent: @651141 Oh no!!!

Is this for residential or wireless phone service?

Customer: @VerizonSupport On Verizon’s advice we called Comcast, Who had the number, and they said they that verizon had sent them a release on 9/15 we didn’t ask for

Customer: @VerizonSupport The phone is working again.

Comcast never activated it after the # was released by Verizon because nobody (I️.e.

me) asked them to do so.

Agent: @651141 Should your number be with Verizon or Comcast?

Customer: @VerizonSupport However they never activate this # that was release by Verizon because we never asked them to get it, but Verizon seems to think we did.

Customer: @VerizonSupport Verizon.

We switched to Verizon in April.

Customer: @VerizonSupport All we want is to pay the price we paid for months before all of this happened with no impetus from us.

It seems unlikely Verizon cant do so

Agent: @651141 We can have a billing specialist look into it.
