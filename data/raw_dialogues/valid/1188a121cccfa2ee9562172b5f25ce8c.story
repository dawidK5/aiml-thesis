Customer: How can @SW_Help sell enough tickets for a 10 coach train and a 5 coach one appears!

Awful journey and service.

Agent: @437870 The majority of our customers buy a ticket for a journey and not the individual train, we do not limit the amount 1/3

Agent: @437870 of people who board, and leave it to passenger discretion, as it can cause more issues to refuse entry.

In this case I apologise for the 2/3

Agent: @437870 inconvenience, however there was a fault on one of the units putting it out of use and we had no choice but to run with 5 coaches.

^BV 3/3

Customer: @SW_Help I appreciate you saying that but you donâ€™t even know what train it is that ran with the 5 coaches not 10.

Most unsatisfactory!!

!

Agent: @437870 Apologies I assumed that it was the 18:30 from Waterloo to Weymouth as that was the one I was aware of.
