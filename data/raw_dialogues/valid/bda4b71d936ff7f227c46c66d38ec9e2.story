Customer: @115769â€“ help!

Since your update from 6 to CC all my RAM is being used to just run basic functions.

Editing time has slowed to a crawl because each photo takes minutes to work on instead of seconds.

Agent: @638823 Hi Sarah, do you have Lightroom Classic CC installed?

Also, please try the steps mentioned in the article to improve Lightroom performance: https://t.co/bnTQklVUca .

Customer: @AdobeCare Yep, I have classic CC installed.

I've also made sure to increase the Cache size, defragment the disc, and the other things listed.

It helped a little, but it's still overwhelmingly eating up my RAM.

Agent: @638823 Thanks for the additional information, Sarah.

We're looking into this and will follow up with next steps ASAP ^Madison

Agent: @638823 How much RAM do you have on your computer?

^Tanuj

Customer: @AdobeCare 8GB.

But I've realized that the problem isn't RAM but the process.

It is constantly freezing and eating up every bit of space.

This didn't happen until the switch to CC.

Agent: @638823 Hi Sarah, May be its a repeated suggestion, Have you tried turning of the GPU from the Lightroom preferences?

Preferences &gt; Performance tab &gt; Uncheck GPU &gt; Restart Lr.

Thanks.

^MG

Customer: @AdobeCare Yeah, I've had that turned off for a long time

Agent: @638823 Hi Sarah, Could you please help us with screenshots of the high CPU usage you've reported?

Have you tried running Lightroom with no other apps running in the background and how much RAM is being used by Lightroom when it is idle?

Thanks, ^AK https://t.co/iuwZCjz4Or
