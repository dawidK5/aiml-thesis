Customer: @SpotifyCares Can't create an account.

Firefox, Chrome, iPhone:  "oops something went wrong".

I give up.

Agent: @169721 Hey Brandon!

Can you try clearing your browser's cache/cookies?

See if that helps /RH

Customer: @SpotifyCares Chrome reset to defaults gets an endless spinner.

So does an Incognito window.

Agent: @169721 Alright.

What country are you in?

Have you also tried using a different device?

That might do the trick /RH

Customer: @SpotifyCares USA.

The iPhone app says "an unknown error has occurred."

I also tried switching phone and laptop from wifi to a phone network.

No change

Agent: @169721 Could you send us a screenshot of the error message you're getting?

We'll take a look /RH

Customer: @SpotifyCares On Firefox, it's simply the signup form with a spinner in the center.

The browser console looks like this: https://t.co/JKnhOkvpxY

Agent: @169721 Thanks for the screenshots.

Could you also DM us the email address that you're trying to use?

Let's carry on chatting there /RH https://t.co/ldFdZRiNAt
