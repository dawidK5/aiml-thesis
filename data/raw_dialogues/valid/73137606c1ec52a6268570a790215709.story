Customer: Got an offer code from @116057.

After using code, needed to change the order.

Not an option, so canceled &amp; reorder.

Customer: @116057 Congratulations, @116057, this is how you lose a customer before they even become one.

Good job.

I'll use @115877 instead.

Agent: @164296 If an order is cancelled the promo code goes back on your account for future use.

Customer: @Postmates_Help Where does it say that?

The order total doesn't indicate the discount.

Agent: @164296 You should see a discount on your delivery fee.

Feel free to DM us your account email so we can look into that for you!

Customer: @Postmates_Help It wasn't a discount on the delivery.

It was $15 off the total.

Agent: @164296 Oh!

In that case, the credit doesn't show until after the order is complete.

Customer: @Postmates_Help That's just confusing.
