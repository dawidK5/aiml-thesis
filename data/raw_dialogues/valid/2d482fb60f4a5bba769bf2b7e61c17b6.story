Agent: @637766 Hi there!

Can you tell us where in Spain you're located?

We'll see what we can suggest /NH

Customer: @SpotifyCares I'm in Madrid

Agent: @637766 Thanks!

Do you have a VPN enabled?

If so, try disabling it to see if it helps.

Let us know how it goes /NH

Customer: @SpotifyCares Nope!

No VPN

Agent: @637766 Got it.

Can you let us know what country your Google Account is set to?

Also, is this the first time you're downloading the app?

/NH

Customer: @SpotifyCares Looks like account country is set to Serbia.

I'll see if I can change it right now

Customer: @SpotifyCares Changed it and it works now.

Thanks!

Agent: @637766 No worries!

We're glad we could help out.
