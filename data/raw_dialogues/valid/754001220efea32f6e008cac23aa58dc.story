Customer: @XboxSupport Help please!

My Kinect won't turn on my #XboxOneX console.

It works properly for all other functions... https://t.co/8bCK3yKiqy

Agent: @143699 Hey there.

For this let's start with this page: https://t.co/fWysyqMo1f .

Keep us in the loop.

^IS

Customer: @XboxSupport I read that page, didn't really help.

The Kinect works in all things except to turn on the console (it goes dark when the console turns off)

Agent: @143699 Got it.

What happens after you try to reset it with these steps: https://t.co/rjx0Sp33Op ?

If still nothing let's toggle the setting off.

Then power cycle: https://t.co/QENEhDs7tB and toggle back on and try.

^IS

Customer: @XboxSupport That didn't work either.

Keep in mind it is connected using the Kinect adapter to the XboxOneX.

I did not have the problem with the ol Xbone

Agent: @143699 For sure.

Definitely odd.

When you went through the reset steps did you unplug the whole adapter or just the Kinect from the adapter?

^IS

Customer: @XboxSupport Whole thing.

Agent: @143699 Got it.

Definitely odd.

One thing that would be worth trying is unplugging the Kinect adapter then factory resetting the console keeping your games and apps: https://t.co/K9uQAXyBv8 .

Keep us in the loop.

^IS

Customer: @XboxSupport One other thing: The Kinect actually powers down when the console turns off - it didn't do that with my old Xbox.

Agent: @143699 Hmm.

To be sure previously did you have the Xbox One or the Xbox One?

Definitely sounding odd.

^IS

Customer: @XboxSupport I had an original Xbox One.

Just upgraded to Xbox One X.

Everything worked fine on old box (and still does when I plug it in there)

Agent: @143699 Thanks for that info.

Do you currently have the console set to Energy saving mode: https://t.co/iipXerPMMD or instant on mode?

^JA

Customer: @XboxSupport It is set to instant on.

Customer: @XboxSupport Here are the current settings.

Agent: @143699 Hey there, what happens if you use the Cortana commands instead of the Xbox commands?

https://t.co/UROdT6kHAa ^XS

Customer: @XboxSupport It doesn't seem to matter.

The Kinect powers down when the console sleeps, hence it doesn't have power to turn the box on.

Agent: @143699 Let's have you try reaching out to chat: https://t.co/aWWrMN54Vu support as they will be better equipped to assist you further.
