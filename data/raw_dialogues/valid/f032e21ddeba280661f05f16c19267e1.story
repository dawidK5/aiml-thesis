Customer: Eager to get to DTW to engage w/@389184.

However,  stuck on tarmac in MKE cause my @AmericanAir flight has unknown glitch.

Agent: @389183 Our crew's working hard to prepare for takeoff and we'll have you in DTW as soon as we have a chance.

We appreciate your patience.

Customer: @AmericanAir I get it.

I'm probably going to miss my connection in ORD to DTW.

So I gotta figure that situation out.

Agent: @389183 We've added a back up flight for you to DTW, just in case it's needed.

Customer: @AmericanAir Will prob need it as connection is departing in 5 min, and I'm still taxiing in ORD

Agent: @389183 Please see an agent upon arrival then and they'll issue you a new boarding pass.

Customer: @AmericanAir Should I go to the gate my departed flight was scheduled or where should I find  an agent?

Agent: @389183 You can speak with the agent that will meet your inbound aircraft or go to your next gate G16.

Please check the monitors upon arrival.

Customer: @AmericanAir No agent, so I went to G16.

Soonest they could rebook me-12:20 departure.

Not ideal given that puts me 3 hours late for my DTW meeting.

Agent: @389183 We hear your frustration and apologize that you're arriving later than originally planned and for any inconvenience caused.

Customer: @AmericanAir When you had mentioned "backup flight" I may have gotten my hopes up that I'd make my meeting.

I need to manage my expectations better.

Agent: @389183 We're sorry that we didn't have any flights sooner, or we'd have you on your way to the meeting now.
