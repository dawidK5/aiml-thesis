Customer: iOS 11 fucked up my music app ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è https://t.co/0tdwV1WWra

Customer: @AppleSupport

Agent: @374419 We'd like to help.

What's happening with the Music App?

Customer: @AppleSupport Lock screen controls don't work anymore.

Also, when I connect my phone to my car with a lightning cable, I can't change songs anymore.

Customer: @AppleSupport From the lock screen I used to be able to see album art, and control next/previous songs, but now it doesn't show any of that.

Agent: @374419 Which iOS version is your device running?

Tap on Settings &gt; General &gt; About.

Have you tried restarting your device?

Customer: @AppleSupport Working better after restart, which is weird I've restarted it before and the issue still occurred.

Thanks for the help!

Agent: @374419 Let us know if the issue returns.

Customer: @AppleSupport Issue seems to be caused by connecting my phone to my car via bluetooth.

Once it finally connects, my iPhone music player becomes unusable.

Agent: @374419 Thank your for keeping us updated.

Please DM us and we can continue from there.
