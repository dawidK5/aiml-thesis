Customer: @VirginTrains  Westcoast wins after experiencing Eastcoast today for the 1st time 😂 5 1/2 hours home - Stevenage, I can drive in 3.5.

More frazzled than tackling the M1 &amp; missed my meeting!!

Not all virgins fault but short staff and delayed train from Doncaster did not help 👊🏻

I’m with you all the way  😉👍🏻

Agent: @280717 We look forward to seeing you back onboard, Sue 😊 ^HP
