Customer: Come on @O2 fix your connection with Carphone Warehouse so my upgrade can actually go through before I go on holiday.

I've been trying to do this for days

Agent: @678519 ü§î We'd like to help Claire, are you trying to upgrade through Carphone Warehouse?

If so, you'd need to discuss any issues further with them.

What's happened exactly?

Customer: @O2 I called them today and on Saturday and they say that no O2 upgrades are going through - apparently an issue on your side.

Only new contract sales are currently possible.

Is this true?

Agent: @678519 ü§î We're not currently aware of any issues, Claire.

Why not upgrade through us directly?

Have you spoken to the upgrades team directly to discuss your options?

You can reach them here: https://t.co/EVzkGH5WQZ They'd be more than happy to help üëç

Customer: @O2 The offer they had online was a better offer than your upgrade section had.

I'm currently losing my voice so just wanted to order online and not have to speak to someone on my basically broken phone which is what I'm trying to replace

Agent: @678519 Ah okay, when's the last time you tried upgrading?

Customer: @O2 I had a look at the options on the site for the phone I wanted less than a week ago

Agent: @678519 Okay, are you still having the same issues?

What's the latest you've been advised by Carphone Warehouse?

Customer: @O2 I haven't heard anything further from them.

Never got a call back and there is only so much time you can waste on hold

Agent: @678519 We'd suggest getting back in touch with Carphone Warehouse Claire.

We're sorry for the inconvenience.
