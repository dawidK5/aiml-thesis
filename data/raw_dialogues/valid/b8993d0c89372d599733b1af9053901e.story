Customer: @AskPlayStation So what should I do if I want some actual support for issues with my PS4?

Agent: @305746 Sorry for the delay.

Please follow the steps in the next link: https://t.co/ZTQiswJ84L

Customer: @AskPlayStation And if none of those work?

Customer: @AskPlayStation Because nothing there fixes the problem.

And it's only been a problem since the last system software update.

Agent: @305746 Please go to Safe Mode and select Restore Default Settings.

Customer: @AskPlayStation Thank you!

That seems to have done the trick.

Agent: @305746 You're welcome.

Happy gaming!

Customer: @AskPlayStation Spoke too soon.

Problem is back again today.

Agent: @305746 Sorry to hear that!
