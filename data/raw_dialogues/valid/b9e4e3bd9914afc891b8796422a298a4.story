Customer: ordered somethin on @115937 &amp; accidentally used my parents addy cuz it was default&amp; requested to cancel right away and it was still too late ?

Agent: @490757 The seller should still be able to cancel it unless they've already shipped it.

Have you reached out to them?

Customer: @AskeBay I put in the request to cancel like 10min after i made the order because i made mistake on the address /1

Customer: @AskeBay I didnt received a message till today  in the evening that they couldn’t cancel because it has shipped/2

Customer: @AskeBay Yet its not showing as shipped on my ebay app nor have i received a tracking  number ?

Agent: @490757 That's strange.

Have you said this to them?

If it has been sent, will your parents be able to collect it &amp; get it to you?^BC

Customer: @AskeBay Yes i did and they should i just wont get the package in time

Agent: @490757 I see.

I'm afraid there's nothing we can do as we can't force the seller to cancel the transaction for you if it's sent.

Agent: @490757  I would recommend to continue to work with the seller and open a returns request if it doesn't arrive on time.
