Customer: @nationalrailenq ...would it be possible to use my ticket on the 9:11 that's delayed by about an hour and should arrive at 10:03?

Agent: @488574 Hi there, I'm so sorry about this, I can't see this being a problem at all.

Customer: @nationalrailenq Ok great!

My ticket is supposed to be for the 10:11 only so shall I show this tweet if any problems?

Agent: @488574 If you visit the ticket office, they will confirm whether you can use the ticket with the circumstances.

Customer: @nationalrailenq Ok thankyou!

Customer: @nationalrailenq Great the 9:11 has been cancelled anyways ðŸ˜­

Agent: @488574 Unfortunately we have now received reports of a signalling issue between Leeds and Wakefield.

Customer: @nationalrailenq Fabulous
