Customer: @Delta I’ve been trying to contact Delta about changing my reservation.

They keep saying they’ll call me &amp; I won’t lose my place in line.

Now it’s past the window to change the res w out a fee.

Still haven’t gotten through to anyone.

Agent: @769085 Oh no!

So sorry for that.

Could you provide your confirmation number via DM so I can assist?

Customer: @Delta Thank you, that was excellent resolution, glad I sent that tweet just in time while I still had a window to change the itinerary without a fee.

Agent: @769085 We are happy to have been able to help!

Have a great day!

Customer: @Delta The one issue is that I didn’t receive confirmation of the cancellation or the return of my miles or money to my account.

Agent: @769085 Good Morning Daniel.

I see where the redeposit was requested yesterday.

Please allow up to 3-5 business days for the miles to be returned to your account.
