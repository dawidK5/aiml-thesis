Customer: @VirginAmerica how can you let your staff promote another airline they know nothing about?

@AlaskaAir please train VX staff so they don’t look like idiots to those who have flown VX for years...and fix the aircraft seats, etc... #disappointedguest #ImDone

Agent: @493901 I am sorry we doing our best to understand each product.

Can you tell me what happened so I can share and hope this doesn't happen again.

Customer: @AlaskaAir essentially service in 1st has steadily declined in the past six months.

ex: seats don’t recline, when they do, often need reset to sit up, inoperable inflight ent.

system (2 fly’s), no knowledge by phone personnel re: meal service on red eye flight, general service declined

Customer: @AlaskaAir it’s a huge disappointment for someone like me who flies VX frequently.

I am elevate gold member with 75K in miles.

I refuse to spend another penny on VX because of the decline.

How does @AlaskaAir plan on retaining loyal VX guests with the decline in service?

Agent: @493901 I'm very sorry about this.

I will share your feedback with our leadership team.

Customer: @AlaskaAir sorry doesn’t cut it anymore.

I hear lots of “sorry” onboard and i the phone -  and not a lot of solution.

it continues to get worse each flight.

i’d be embarrassed to treat guests in 1st this way.

Customer: @AlaskaAir additionally the VX inflight team doesn’t enforce the lavatory rules in 1st.

flying VX used to be such a great experience - now it’s nothing more than a city bus.

Ugh!
