Customer: @CoxHelp hi, need help setting my modem/router combo to bridges mode.

Agent: @165297  The modem you desccribed handles Internet, home network, and telephone service.

-Chris

Agent: @165297  It can be exchanged for one that handles just the Internet and telephone services.

-Chris

Customer: @CoxHelp I bought this modem outright from you in 2013.

How do I go about exchanging it?

Customer: @CoxHelp So do I go to a cox store?

Agent: @165297 The 3925's are not allowed to be purchased, I could check your account however it's likely a rental.

-Chris

Customer: @CoxHelp It's a 3825.

Agent: @165297  Hi Kyle, that definitely does make a difference then (no phone), DM the account info and I can see what the situation is.-Chris

Customer: @CoxHelp Thanks Chris.
