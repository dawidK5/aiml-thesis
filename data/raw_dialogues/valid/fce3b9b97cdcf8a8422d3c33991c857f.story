Customer: @115888 when you say click the banner for 30 minutes of ad free listening.

Shouldn’t I get 30 minutes of ad free listening instead of 10?

Agent: @495535 Hey Travis, that doesn't sound good!

Did the app crash at any point during the 30 minutes?

That can cause the ad-free time to reset /MC

Customer: @SpotifyCares No it did not.

Continuous listening.

Customer: @SpotifyCares Also why does my girlfriends account go three or more songs between ads and mine usually one after being a long time premium account

Agent: @495535 Thanks!

Just to confirm, did you watch the video ad that grants you 30 minutes ad-free listening in full after hearing the offer?

/MC

Customer: @SpotifyCares Yes

Customer: @SpotifyCares Spotify followed up by thanking me for watching the ad and then informing me that I could enjoy the next 30 minutes of ad free listening

Agent: @495535 That's strange.

We'll get this passed on to our devs so they can look into it.

For now, give us a shout if you need anything else /MC
