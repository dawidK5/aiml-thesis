Customer: @GWRHelp 1st class WiFi is slower then dial up.... What a waste upgrading my ticket ðŸ˜¡

Agent: @310046 Hi Viccy.

What service are you on please?

Rach

Customer: @GWRHelp It's awful https://t.co/no4wiu4Mwv

Agent: @310046 To confirm, you're on the 0815 departure from Paddington?

Phil.

Customer: @GWRHelp Yup

Agent: @310046 Thanks - Are you having trouble connecting or is it running slowly?

Phil.

Customer: @GWRHelp Connected fine.

Running painfully slow.

Agent: @310046 Sorry to hear this.

Speed and connectivity is dependent on the mobile signal in the area as well as the number of users at a time.

Rach

Customer: @GWRHelp Well it says low users, and there's more empty seats then used...

So just a poor show really!

Agent: @310046 It could also be that mobile signal in the area is not so fast - I'll record your feedback.

Phil.
