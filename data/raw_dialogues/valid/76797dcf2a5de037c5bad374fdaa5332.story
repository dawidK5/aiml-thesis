Customer: 2/2 @VirginTrains spending £50+ on train tickets doesn’t give me the right to get on an earlier train, despite mine being heavily delayed.

Agent: @821313 Were you travelling with an Advance ticket for your journey?

^CB

Customer: @VirginTrains Yes, have no problem with my normal train but this delay will make me: miss my next train from Bham,then add an hour+ to my drive time after

Agent: @821313 I understand the frustration with the delay.

As that service is still in operation you do have to travel as booked ^CB

Customer: @VirginTrains Which is bull.

What ever happened to compassion?

Seems you guys don’t care once money has changed hands

Customer: @VirginTrains It’s not as if it was peak time - the train was near empty leaving the station here.

Agent: @821313 That is the condition of that fare.

It is only valid on the booked train.

Staff will have followed the correct procedure ^CB

Customer: @VirginTrains Well the booked train is not arriving at the time I booked for.

Customer: @VirginTrains So the service I have PAID for does not exist

Customer: @VirginTrains Here’s ANOTHER route I could have taken https://t.co/CmSfxKO30p

Customer: @VirginTrains Again, an empty train

Agent: @821313 Advance fares are only valid on the booked service, which is still running ^CB

Customer: @VirginTrains Yeah, you keep saying that.

Obviously missing my next train means nothing?

Customer: @VirginTrains And it is running 24 mins late currently.

You think that is a service worth paying for?

Agent: @821313 I'm afraid I'm unable to advise further on this as staff have followed the correct protocol in these circumstances ^CB
