Customer: @116549 amazon without warning canceled my Xbox one x order.

How can I still get on 7th.

Please help this is such bullsh***

Agent: @423984 We'd love to help, Robert!

First we'll need a little more info.

Did we send an e-mail explaining the cancellation?

Customer: @AmazonHelp You sent an email saying the card was declined but in that same email you canceled the order?

Customer: @AmazonHelp My account was recently breached so I received a new card

Agent: @423984 Orders with payment issues cancel if the payment isn't updated in 3 days.

I'm sorry for any inconvenience this causes!

Customer: @AmazonHelp But the email was only 1 day old!

Which means you canceled in only 1 day.

Customer: @AmazonHelp So how does this make since.

Now I’m screwed

Customer: @AmazonHelp Why can’t my exact order be re-ordered.

The 1 unit that I pre ordered should be available since you don’t even take pre orders for weeks.
