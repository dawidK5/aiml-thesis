Customer: @sprintcare we have called several times and even emailed sprint corporate.

Customer: @sprintcare we keep being told the same thing “2-5 days” “we’ll contact you shortly” etc.

Customer: @sprintcare yet the issue has still not been fixed.

Customer: @sprintcare it seems the only way to get your attention is bad publicity.

Agent: @152116 To me customer service is doing the right thing, that's why I would like to speak about this on a private platform.

Please DM me so I can further assists you.
