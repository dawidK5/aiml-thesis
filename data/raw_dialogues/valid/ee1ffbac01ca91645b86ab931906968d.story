Customer: @116021 is really getting on my nerves can't watch anything but live TV now because of this stupid Netflix thing.

You either pay more for a Netflix account and/or more channels or you are just left SOL....come on y'all really

Agent: @704062   I want to help.

Please DM us your full service address, so we can investigate this further.

Thank you.

Customer: @CoxHelp But no way to separate the free on demand from the Netflix items.

Even searching different ways doesn't help 90% of the things that show up are still done through only Netflix or a subscription

Agent: @704062 We have no control on separating or changing what comes on Netflix or od demand.

We do apologize for any inconvenience this has caused.

Thank you.

Customer: @CoxHelp Well it's something to work on.

Like put an icon on it or something at least so people don't waste their time going through the movies wasting their time cause they don't know what's actually free and what's just gonna reroute them to netflix

Agent: @704062 Hi Jessica, if you have Contour 2 it can be filtered out.

Customer: @CoxHelp How would I get that?

Pay more for it?
