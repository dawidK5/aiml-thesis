Customer: @LondonMidland cancelling a train 20min before arrival is unacceptable!

teenage son cycled to the station to find out train is now cancelled

Agent: @493804 Hi Tracey, sorry to hear this.

Where is he travelling between?

Customer: @LondonMidland From Tring to Hemel Hempstead!

It’s his only form of transport for work - the train was on time when he checked before he left!

Agent: @493804 I am sorry, there are over run engineering works which means we lost possession of the line.

Unfortunately, this did result..1/2

Agent: @493804 2/2.. in us cancelling the already very late running train.

Please pass on my apologies to your son.

Customer: @LondonMidland An apology isn’t going to get him to work!!

!

Customer: @LondonMidland Do London Midland want to call his boss and explain why he’s late for work today?

?

Agent: @493804 As explained, Network Rail are responsible for the late works.

We had no possession of the line.

This means we could not run..1/2

Agent: @493804 2/2.. any trains.

Should your son require a letter of confirmation for today's delay, we will be more than happy to provide this.
