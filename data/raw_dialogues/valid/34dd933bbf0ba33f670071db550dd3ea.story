Customer: @GWRHelp hi guys, can I get a refund for a cancelled train?

Technically, awful service tonight I'm afraid.

Agent: @137807 Hi Michael.

Sorry for the disruption.

What journey are you making and what type of ticket do you hold?

Lewis

Customer: @GWRHelp Cheers (again) Lewis.

We're no stranger to each other haha

Oxford to Newport_SW.

Ticket is part of a return but individually, is a super off peak single

Agent: @137807 If delayed by an hour you can claim compensation here: https://t.co/kZncdam7bx.

Customer: @GWRHelp Forgive me for being thick but, my train was cancelled.

I'll be home over an hour late so delayed is correct but technically not correct?

Agent: @137807 Compensation is based on the delay to your journey.

If the cancellation means you arrive at your destination an hour later, you can claim.

Customer: @GWRHelp Awesome, thanks for your help this evening Lewis.

Agent: @137807 You're welcome.

Sorry again for the problems this evening.
