Customer: I’ve had my iPhoneX since Thursday and still don’t have all my apps loaded.

What gives, @AppleSupport?

Agent: @795102 We know everyone is excited to get their iPhone X and start enjoying it.

Let’s work together to get your apps installed on the iPhone.

Can you tell us what happens when you try to download your apps?

Customer: @AppleSupport When I first restored from back up the majority of them were stuck in “loading” or “waiting” I tried deleting and reinstalling, but nothing gets past the “loading” phase.

Agent: @795102 Got it.

If you stop the downloads and only download one at a time, do the apps download successfully?

Customer: @AppleSupport They do not.

I’ve tried that.

Agent: @795102 Are you connected to a know good Wi-Fi network or using cellular data?

Customer: @AppleSupport I have tried both individually and together.

Agent: @795102 Please tell us which version of iOS you have installed on your iPhone X.

You'll see this in Settings &gt; General &gt; About.

Customer: @AppleSupport 11.1.2

Agent: @795102 Thanks for confirming this.

We'd like to gather some additional details.

Let's connect is DM.
