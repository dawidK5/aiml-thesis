Customer: @XboxSupport Is it normal for my Xbox One X to be making pretty loud fan noises?

Even while the console is off?

It seems to be louder than my original One.

Agent: @682850 Hiya!

Just to clarify, does your console have plenty of room for ventilation: https://t.co/zI97SiDxFi Also, is your console plugged directly into a wall outlet?

^JA

Customer: @XboxSupport Yes it does have plenty of ventilation, and no it is not directly to the wall outlet.

I have it connected to a surge protector.

Agent: @682850 Thanks for this info, a direct wall outlet connection would be recommended: https://t.co/nflNKVYTaW If you 1 ^EZ

Agent: @682850 plug the console directly into the wall outlet &amp; test for a bit, do you hear this noise?

2 ^EZ

Customer: @XboxSupport It seems to have stopped that noise, thank you!

Also does having it connected to a surge protector mess up the console in any way?

Because that noise was worrying me

Agent: @682850 We could not speculate on this, but a surge protector is not recommended since the power supply has built-in protection.

Customer: @XboxSupport Okay, thanks again!
