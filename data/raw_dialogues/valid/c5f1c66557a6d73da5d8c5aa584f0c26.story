Agent: @702126 Hi James, it looks like their off rather than out of order.

Which store was this in please?

Thanks, Leah.

Customer: @Tesco Queensway

Agent: @702126 Hi James, I've spoken to the management at the store and they informed me the lanes were simply closed.

Agent: @702126 She also let me know that there were seven other lanes still open at this time too :).

Hope this clears things up.

Customer: @Tesco Not really!

Why would half the automated tolls be closed when there’s a line of people waiting... Hopefully @1547 will open near by soon

Agent: @702126 Hi James, I'm sorry some of our tills were closed, your feedback has been given to my colleagues in store.

Agent: @702126 I hope that we can make some changes to prevent large queues in future for you.

Thanks - Laura 2/2
