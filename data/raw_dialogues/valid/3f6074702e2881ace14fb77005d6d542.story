Agent: @159570 Hi there!

That's a standard hold used to verify your payment method.

The funds never actually leave your account, and the charge is voided.

Customer: @Uber_Support They where just deducted from my account I got a notification from my bank

Agent: @159570 Thank you for providing the info.

We are looking into your account right now.
