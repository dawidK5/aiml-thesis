Customer: Hi @SpotifyCares, any chance this may become a regular feature?

Iâ€™d love for all my tunes to come on a set :) https://t.co/RbZgBm5Pe8

Agent: @290314 1: Hi Aswin!

You can actually do that now by adjusting the app's Crossfade settings.

Check this out: https://t.co/mKMS0iCZE3.

Agent: @290314 2: also check out our party playlists' DJ-quality transitions.

Just enter "spotify:genre:party" in the Search bar ðŸŽˆ /RR

Customer: @SpotifyCares Iâ€™ve done this, but I canâ€™t cross-fade beyond 12 seconds?

Ideally Iâ€™d like to set it at 40-50 seconds.

Is that customizable?

Customer: @SpotifyCares Thanks but 
1)no drum n bass playlists
2)doesnâ€™t mix/cross-fade like the Stepping Out playlist 
ðŸ˜ž

Agent: @290314 We hear you!

Make sure to show your support for the idea at https://t.co/UFmKVuzwKK.

Customer: @SpotifyCares Thank you but I think this is the one I am voting for :) https://t.co/8z2o25Wcsh

Agent: @290314 Awesome!

Give us a shout if there's anything else.

For now, https://t.co/M9DGmitf5G ðŸ¤˜ /GT
