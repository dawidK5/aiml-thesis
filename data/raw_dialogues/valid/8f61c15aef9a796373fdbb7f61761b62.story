Customer: @British_Airways When will we hear back then?

It's been a month aready!

Most companies have a 48-72 hour response time, a month from BA is beyond ridiculous!

Agent: @122258 Our Customer Relations team have an extremely high workload due to recent hurricanes and earthquakes.

Rest assured we'll get in touch soon ^

Customer: @British_Airways Don't we all!

And a lot of us were caught up in those hurricanes &amp; earthquakes.

Most companies increase staff cover throughout busy periods

Agent: @122258 Hi Sarah, please be assured we're doing all we can to process all passenger queries as quickly as possible.

We appreciate your patience.
