Customer: @161612 @ATVIAssist ^

Agent: @397002 Hey there, could you clarify a bit more for me please?

^VH

Customer: @ATVIAssist as i finished the mehastopholis boss fight my game crashed, my friend in my game got the calling card but i didnt because i was host i think

Agent: @397002 That wouldn't effect the rewards.

Could you clarify if you have a video of this?

^VH

Customer: @ATVIAssist do i get calling cards and stuff if my game crashes before the game ends?

and is there a kind of theatre i can get the video from

Agent: @397002 if you complete a challenge it would register on server side.

Then when you boot back up it would give you the reward... ^VH

Agent: @397002 However, if it crashes before completion of the requirements then it would not provide the content.

Customer: @ATVIAssist it crashed right before the cutscene if that means anything

Customer: @ATVIAssist as we placed the taoismans and started shooting him when my screen went white my game crashed

Customer: @ATVIAssist talismans*

Agent: @397002 It sounds like you may have crashed while in the act of doing the boss fight.

Do you have a video that demonstrates this?

^VH

Customer: @ATVIAssist https://t.co/NfjFmTA48a in that video at 12:57 is what it looked like when it crashed

Customer: @ATVIAssist not my video credit to dizzyop

Agent: @397002 Unfortunately I would need a video of your client crashing specifically.
