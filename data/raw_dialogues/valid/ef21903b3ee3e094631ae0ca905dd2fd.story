Customer: Hey @VirginTrains, just tried to by tickets through your app &amp; in the 10 seconds from selecting them to paying they became "unavailable".

Reset the app &amp; now they've gone up!

Really disappointed.

Tempted to go with Chiltern.

Don't supposed you want to offer them at old price?

Agent: @140910 Were these Advance tickets?

If so they are subject to availability and may have been booked by someone else.

Therefore we cannot offer them at the other price.

^BT

Customer: @VirginTrains They were advance tickets, yes, but surely you shouldn't make a product available at a price let peope go through the process and then increase the price.

Other ticketing sites guarantee the ticket is yours, subject to payment, as soon as you select it

Agent: @140910 I'm afraid these can be booked by someone up until the booking page ^MM

Customer: @VirginTrains I was on the booking page.

I'd put my card details in and then it rejected it because you'd sold them to someone else.

Agent: @140910 Do you have a screenshot of this, Chris?

^MM

Customer: @VirginTrains Sadly not as I then had to go out of the app and back in.

That's when the price increased.

Customer: @VirginTrains Don't worry, it's not just you.

@123241 have just done the same ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Agent: @140910 They would be best to advise ^MM
