Customer: @AppleSupport why following the initial recent update does the WiFi keep turning itself on, even after expressly turning it off #iphone6s

Agent: @395371 We can help.

Are you turning off Wi-Fi in the Control Center?

Customer: @AppleSupport Turning off in control centre, then after do not disturb active in car then deactivated when disconnected the WiFi is back same with APM ‚úàÔ∏è

Agent: @395371 Okay.

That is expected in iOS 11.

Check this link for details about that feature: https://t.co/G7BHuQnDS6

Customer: @AppleSupport Thanks but this feature defeats the object of turning it off.

I don‚Äôt need or want the phone looking for a WiFi service when I‚Äôve turned off

Agent: @395371 Understood.

You do have the option of turning Wi-Fi off in Settings &gt; Wi-Fi.

This will disable until you turn it back on.

Customer: @AppleSupport Ruins the whole object of control centre though doesn‚Äôt it!

Kind of pointless üò±
