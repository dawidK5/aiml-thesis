Customer: @AppleSupport I've been having to restart my phone every time I want to update apps otherwise the app store will show an error.

Is this something you are aware of?

Agent: @231128 We appreciate you reaching out and providing us this information.

We know how important it is to have your apps up to date on your device.

To help us look into this issue, can you provide us the iOS on your device?

Customer: @AppleSupport Sure thing.

11.1.2 I believe I’ve had this issue for a few weeks now.

Agent: @231128 Can you provide us what the error says when you try to update your apps?

Customer: @AppleSupport I can take a screenshot next time I have an update available but something along these lines “App Store not working/available at the moment”

Agent: @231128 Got it.

Have you noticed a pattern?

For example, does this happen while connected to Wi-Fi or cellular data?

Does this happen in multiple different locations?

Customer: @AppleSupport Good question.

It’s happened at work and at home so always connected to wifi.

I never try to update using my data.

Agent: @231128 Got it, thanks!
