Customer: For $219 a month I get to watch my @168743 on FS1 in the #ALDS with static on @115722

Agent: @204443 Help has arrived.

Can you try disconnecting both power and coax cables from the box and wall jack?

Reconnect after 30 seconds.

Customer: @VerizonSupport That didn't solve it.

Agent: @204443 The game is again pixelated this evening?

Is it only happening on FS1 or other channels as well?

Customer: @VerizonSupport Yes, again.

I only see the pixelation on FS1.

Agent: @204443 Is it happening on all of your TVs as well?

^RMD

Customer: @VerizonSupport Yes it's happening on all my TVs.

Agent: @204443 Do you know where the main splitter is at in the home?
