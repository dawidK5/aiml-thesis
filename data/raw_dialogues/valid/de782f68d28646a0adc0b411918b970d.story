Customer: So, @VirginTrains it seems that although I bought a ticket from you and the journey was delayed by over half an hour, that I have to wait indefinitely for a refund and call three separate numbers to get anywhere - despite applying online.

Now you've fobbed me onto Northern Rail.

Agent: @773426 Do you have a VT reference number we can view or an Email you can DM us with so we can search.

Customer: @VirginTrains Here's the VT ref no: 2326635614

Agent: @773426 That's the booking reference, when you applied, did you get one that starts VT?

Customer: @VirginTrains I got an auto acknowledgement on 11th October, with no reference: 
Dear Customer, Thank you for your correspondence, this is an automated response to confirm that we have received your email and we will be in touch again soon.

Agent: @773426 I can see a case reference listed VT-111017-0301 which is with our team though you should have received a response by now.

Apologies for this delay.

I've escalated with our Customer Resolutions team ^CB

Customer: @VirginTrains Thank you, I've received an email from them.

But all they are saying is they've forwarded the issue to Northern - again fobbing me off to them.

I bought the ticket from you, not them.

Agent: @773426 If you were delayed on a @121516 service you would need to claim for this through them.

The team have passed this over to Northern to look in to ^CB
