Customer: @ChaseSupport Doesn't work in Safari or Chrome.

I'm in Australia so would rather not rack up long distance charges to find out what's available.

Will just book directly.

Agent: @685781 You can also call us internationally at 1-302-594-8200.

If you work with an international operator to dial collect, we will accept the charges.

In most countries, the best way to reach an international operator is to use a landline and dial "0.‚Äù ^JM

Customer: @ChaseSupport I appreciate that that's an option but I want an easy way to look at all the inventory in an unfamiliar city, and doing that over the phone seems like a huge pain in the butt.

Gonna use cash/other points instead.

Agent: @685781 Thank you for providing this information.

Feel free to reach out to us again if you have any additional questions.
