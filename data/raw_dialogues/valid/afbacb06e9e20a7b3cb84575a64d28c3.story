Customer: @VerizonSupport @115725 @115722 Why does this error on your app keep happening almost once/wk?

My dad has to spend hrs on phone to fix https://t.co/aBQrYWAUuO

Agent: @554626 We do apologize for the inconvenience.

Are you able to log into https://t.co/gkmHFnzJtb?

Customer: @VerizonSupport No, he has to.

Idk his security question answers &amp; it keeps forgetting my computer.

I want to know why this error keeps happening.

Customer: @VerizonSupport And we're talking a maximum of 2 weeks now where this doesn't happen.

It's ridiculous.

Agent: @554626 It could be that there have been to many failed attempts to sign in with the correct info.

It can also be that the password was changed.^JRA

Customer: @VerizonSupport There were ZERO attempts to login when I opened the app.

Customer: @VerizonSupport And no it wasn't changed.

Customer: @VerizonSupport I know because this has happened a dozen times now.

Customer: @VerizonSupport Don't guess at the reasons.

Give the error code to your engineers and look into it.

Agent: @554626 Please attempt to log into the account at https://t.co/gkmHFnzJtb.

Agent: @554626 That message will appear when the account information cannot be verified.

^NHP

Customer: @VerizonSupport And nothing has changed since the last time I opened the app.

The password is saved and didn't change.

Agent: @554626 Is the password saved in the device?

Log into the account at https://t.co/gkmHFnzJtb.

Manually type in the password.

Customer: @VerizonSupport To be continued when I have the answer to the security question cuz it forgets my computer.

He's out of town &amp; I've emailed him.

Customer: @VerizonSupport Every time it makes him create a new pw after this happens.

Customer: @VerizonSupport Do you know how many pws we've gone thru in the last few months?

I lost count

Agent: @554626 Please have him manually type the password in and not use the information saved in the application.
