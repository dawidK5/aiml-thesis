Customer: Okay for some reason Spotify won't let me listen to the album.

Really @SpotifyCares #meaningoflife https://t.co/zNdVSfX0Mc

Agent: @426501 Hey!

Help's here.

What device, operating system, and Spotify version are you rocking?

We'll see what we can suggest /RA

Customer: @SpotifyCares I'm using a Chromebook.

For some reason, this is what I keep getting when I try to start the album.

Agent: @426501 Got it!

Could you try restarting your computer?

Let us know how it goes /RA

Customer: @SpotifyCares I tried and it didn't work.

I even tried logging out of my account and back in and that still didn't work.

Agent: @426501 Hmm, that's odd.

Could you try logging in using a different device and let us know if you're able to play the album?

/RA

Customer: @SpotifyCares I'm able to play it on my kindle fire with one problem.

Customer: @SpotifyCares *no

Agent: @426501 Can you DM us your account's email address?

We'll take a look backstage /RA https://t.co/ldFdZRiNAt
