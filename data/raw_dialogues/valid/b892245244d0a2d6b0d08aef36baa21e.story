Customer: Would love a @115890 update that didn't break something.

Press and hold for right click can't be turned off on @123127 anymore.

Digital artists don't use press and hold, it makes the pen unusable.

Agent: @145449 Let's help you check on this, Arran.

What steps have you tried as far as resolving the press and hold function of your Surface Pen?

As a work around, you may try to put the duration of he press and hold to the longest setting and let us know if that helps out.

Customer: @MicrosoftHelps Ran surface diagnostic, reinstalled drivers +ntrig, ran windows update.

Tried with a different pen.

I think it's the fall update.

I'm on the book performance base.

Agent: @145449 Have you installed the cumulative update for the Windows Fall Creators?

Customer: @MicrosoftHelps My device says everything is up to date :/

Agent: @145449 If the feature is no longer working after the recent update, we can suggest two options.

One is to rollback the update and 2nd is to open Feedback Hub and suggest this features to our developers through this link: https://t.co/YeZOQVxPoi

Agent: @145449 Hi Arran.

Checking back with you.

Were we able to help you resolve your issue?

Customer: @MicrosoftHelps No and I have tested this on a few other PC's now.

It looks as if the fall update has disabled the option to turn off press and hold.

Can you confirm that this is a bug?
