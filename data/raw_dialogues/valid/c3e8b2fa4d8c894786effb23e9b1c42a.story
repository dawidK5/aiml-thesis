Agent: @257826 Hey Kaylie!

Just to check, are those songs grayed-out?

Sending us your device, operating system, and Spotify app version would be handy too /PC

Customer: @SpotifyCares no they aren’t

Customer: @SpotifyCares i’m using an iphone 8

Agent: @257826 Got it.

Are you getting any specific error messages?

If so, a screenshot would be super useful /PC

Customer: @SpotifyCares no, the song won’t play or it will stop exactly at 11 seconds within the song

Agent: @257826 Hmm.

Can you fire over the versions of your iOS and Spotify app?

We'll see what we can suggest /PC

Customer: @SpotifyCares i don’t know what that means

Customer: @SpotifyCares it played until 11 seconds then it stopped and won’t play the rest of the song.

Does this also happen when you use a different device?

Customer: @SpotifyCares not sure

Customer: @SpotifyCares i’ve tried deleting the app and downloading again and nothing is working.
