Customer: @Tesco Hello, I bought 2 Tesco's own Xero Colas and was wondering why one of them tasted awful, it was 8 months out of date (APR 2017) so I checked the other bottle, but that one says APR 2018 and is fine.

Agent: @240999 Hello there, I am sorry you have purchased an out of date bottle of pop, can you please DM your full name, address and email?

Can you also send a pic of your full receipt and the barcode on the coke?

I can issue a Moneycard refund.

1/2

Agent: @240999 I will also call the store when they reopen and ask them to check to ensure there are no more on the shelves.

Would you prefer to receive an email Moneycard you can use straight away, or one posted which can take up to 10 days?

Chris 2/2

Customer: @Tesco That's a great idea, and I'm okay for a refund, it was only 50p.

Agent: @240999 Hey there, I've just called the Park Road Extra store and have spoken with Martin, who is currently the Duty Manager on shift this morning.

1/4

Agent: @240999 Whilst on the phone to him today, he checked the shelves and confirmed that there are no longer any out of date bottles available on shelves; one must have slipped through the net for which he has apologised for.

2/4

Agent: @240999 We'd insist on offering you a refund, given the fact that one of the bottles was out of date, this is a mistake on our part, and one you shouldn't have to pay for.

3/4

Agent: @240999 If you were happy to provide the details requested by Chris, we can get this setup for you and ensure you aren't left out of pocket.

Kind Regards - Rob 4/4

Customer: @Tesco I have sent you a Direct Message with all the details requested.

Agent: @240999 Hi Kristo, that's great, thanks very much.

I've arranged for a refund and extra for another bottle on us.

This will be with you in the next half hour.

If there's anything else I can do for you today, let me know!

TY - Robyn
