Customer: @SW_Help do any of your train attendants actually check to see if there are people still getting on the train before closing doors on them?

Customer: @SW_Help Luckily the transport police at the station were very helpful and made up for it...

Agent: @403187 Hi Elizabeth, can you let me know which service you are referring to please?

Customer: @SW_Help 9.29 from motspur Park

Agent: @403187 Thank you, and sorry to hear of your experience.

I will pass your comments onto the relevant management ^JM

Customer: @SW_Help Thanks - can you also tell me when children’s travel stopped being free as per this article https://t.co/oCJ4EI7L2U

Agent: @403187 Hi, this @TFL page explains how the free travel in London operates https://t.co/nToeZf9S9f ^DP

Customer: @SW_Help @TfL So my daughter should have been free going from motspur Park to Waterloo yesterday - man at the station said we had to pay.

Agent: @403187 @TfL Hi, your daughter would have needed a 5-10 Zip Oyster card in order to have travelled for free yesterday ^DP
