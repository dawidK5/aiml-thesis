Agent: @468661 Hi there, that's very strange indeed.

can you let me know which store this was at and can have a look for you?

Customer: @Tesco Boar lane, Leeds..ain't bothered tbh about not having it.

More the fact the young lad had never heard of it!

Agent: @468661 Sounds like our colleague could have been more helpful, I'd be happy to contact the store to let them know if you like?

Customer: @Tesco Can i have 4 cans of Brewdog Elvis juice as compensation?

As i had to use an Oxo cube instead.. ta

Agent: @468661 Nice try!

But I'm afraid not.

The most I could offer is to log your suggestion that we start selling Bovril in your local store.
