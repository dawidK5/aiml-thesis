Customer: @SpotifyCares hey, any explanation why the "Create similar playlist" function doesn't work anymore for me?

MacBook, v1.0.64.399.g4637b02a.

Agent: @160485 Hi there, the cavalry's here!

Does logging out, restarting your device, and logging back into Spotify help?

Keep us in the loop /JI

Customer: @SpotifyCares no, it didn't :( tried everything but I still can't create the playlist.

it's not even greyed out but nothing happens after clicking on it.

Agent: @160485 Okay.

Can we have you try reinstalling the app?

To do so, just follow the steps at https://t.co/EqisDMwZAT.

Customer: @SpotifyCares i tried and it's still the same... moreover, my song history is always empty, so I can't find songs from previous Discover playlists :(

Agent: @160485 Does restarting your computer help at all?

Also, is the song history you're referring to the History tab on your Play Queue?

Customer: @SpotifyCares no, I tried that as well and just reinstalled again - didn't help.

yes, that's what I mean.

Agent: @160485 Could you DM us your account's email address or username?

We'll take a look backstage /MT https://t.co/ldFdZRiNAt
