Customer: @44334 @XboxSupport I can’t seem to be able to get onto titanfall 2 multiplayer.

It’s telling me my account isn’t permitted to play online.

I’ve tested other games and they work but TF2 still won’t budge.

Customer: @XboxSupport I logged out of my account and the game popped up saying it needed an update.

I have my updates set to auto though so it should already have been done.

Anyway after installing and signing back in I can get onto multiplayer now.

Agent: @642699 Happy to hear that!

It may be that the update just not registered for your console.

Do let us know if you have more issues with the game.
