Agent: @425638 Let's turn your sentiment around!

What's going on with your Fios service?

^DDD

Customer: @VerizonSupport Seems like I can't use my damn Wi-Fi anymore because every other minute my Verizon Wi-Fi is doing this.

Customer: @VerizonSupport I can only shut the router off so many times before I give up and get over charged on my 4G for the month.

Agent: @425638 We'll fix it.

When you lose connection, can you check if the router's internet light turns red?

^DDD

Customer: @VerizonSupport This is what I'm seeing.

It just shut off.... yet again https://t.co/qp9err5kbg

Agent: @425638 Thank you, do you also see the same issue with the device wired to port 1?

^JRA

Customer: @VerizonSupport No.

I never use the wired device

Agent: @425638 It may be wireless interference.

Do you happen to have video services with us to test if on demand is also impacted?
