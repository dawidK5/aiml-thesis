Customer: @GWRHelp Thanks for a £10 refund charge on a £16 ticket because of an error.

GWR profits over service, train is now running 8 minutes late!

Agent: @414697 Hi Michael.

What service are you referring to please?

Rach

Customer: @GWRHelp Thanks for reacting to my main concern.

Your trains are always late particularly during school holidays my concern is about refund charge!

!

Agent: @414697 Can you confirm your booking reference via DM please?

Rach

Customer: @GWRHelp I don't have a booking reference I have a return ticket from a machine.

Why are you charging £10 to change the ticket?

Customer: @GWRHelp It was a peak ticket meant for today but accidentally purchased last night when there were no more peak services left to run in the day

Agent: @414697 If the GWR train you planned to catch was cancelled or delayed, and you didn’t travel, you can claim a full refund.

Agent: @414697 If you decided not to travel for any other reason, we will charge a £10 admin fee for every application made.

2/2 Rach

Customer: @GWRHelp what costs does a £10 admin charge cover?

Your machine broke as I purchased a ticket which led to me rushing and buying for wrong day.

Agent: @414697 Can you send me a photo of the tickets via DM please?
