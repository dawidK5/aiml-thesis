Customer: @VirginTrains got an advance ticket for 13:23 to Coventry from Euston.

Might miss as been delayed on other trains, can I get train after

Agent: @720912 Are you travelling with a ticket that includes a connection at Coventry, or is this a single fare?

^CB

Customer: @VirginTrains I finish at Coventry

Agent: @720912 Are you travelling with a single fare from Euston to Coventry, or is this a connection?

^CB

Customer: @VirginTrains Hi this is a connection.

I started my journey in maidstone and ticket is maidstone to Coventry

Agent: @720912 Be sure to speak with station staff when you arrive in to London as they can endorse the fare to travel on a later train ^CB

Customer: @VirginTrains Could I ask which staff this is.

E.g.

Virgin staff or staff of company I was delayed on.

Agent: @720912 I would speak to both to ensure they can endorse and advise further ^CB
