Agent: #VTUPDATE Services are likely to face delays for the remainder of the day https://t.co/8Nd6h3aBZ1

Customer: @VirginTrains Unimpressed at Birmingham New street.

Platform is jammed, no direction, it is absolute carnage!

Agent: @287397 Not great to hear, there has been issues today with a points failure causing this, Frankie ^MW

Customer: @VirginTrains My journey was disrupted in the morning already so knew about the problem, however directing and informing passengers would be helpful!

Especially when 3 trainloads of people try to get on one train!

Agent: @287397 We can appreciate that, many apologies ^MW

Customer: @VirginTrains Just to add to the insult on a packed and heavily delayed train.

No onboard service either.

The staff doesn’t even try.

Agent: @287397 Sorry for your expereince, Delay Repay compensation is available to those who have been caught up in disruption and delayed by over 30 minutes.

Customer: @VirginTrains Not good at all.

Disappointing.

Can’t claim delay repay as the train has “only” 25 minutes delay.
