Agent: @732937 Hello there, what's up?

Please, tell us a bit more of what's going on.

Customer: @sprintcare Trying to cancel a line I thought I already did but was told I could not because the phone had an ap on it that needed to be turned off.

Phone is lost

Agent: @732937 Was the phone an iphone?

Customer: @sprintcare Yes.

It has been lost for years

Agent: @732937 Do you still have your itunes/icloud login to turn it off.

Customer: @sprintcare It was my kids phone he doesn't know it

Agent: @732937 We would recommend calling apple and see if they can help with the login information or can possibly turn off that feature.
