Agent: @370980 @43734 Hi Laura, we do have the warning in the blue box for our UK tubs.

Customer: @marksandspencer @43734 That just says Nuts.

Peanuts are different.

Why be more specific in other languages?

This is life or death for sufferers.

Customer: @marksandspencer @43734 @5453 @15633 Do other companies list different allergies in other languages?

Are the labelling rules that vague?

Agent: @370980 @43734 @5453 @15633 We've just looked into this for you, Laura.

Customer contacts have shown an increase in questions about whether nut labeling includes 1/4

Agent: @370980 @43734 @5453 @15633 both nuts and peanuts.

As a result, we’re changing our nut alibi labelling to make it clearer for our customers.

The allergy information

Agent: @370980 @43734 @5453 @15633 on the back of the packaging will now separate nut and peanut allergies.

We’re making these changes gradually but customers may 3/4

Agent: @370980 @43734 @5453 @15633 start to notice the change over the next few weeks.

We hope this helps.
