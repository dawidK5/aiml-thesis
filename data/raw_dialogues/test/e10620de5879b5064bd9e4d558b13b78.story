Customer: @Sw_help morning.

How is the 846 fnb-wat train looking today?

Agent: @120742 Hi Nick, this train is currently on time between Winchester and Basingstoke.

Customer: @SW_Help We left on time.

What's with the stop start crawl into Surbiton?

Bet you're going to make me late, as usual

Customer: @SW_Help Ah, 12 minutes behind, so far.

Marvellous.

Keep purposefully running a bad service so you can cut loads out in the new timetable

Agent: @120742 Hi Nick, there have been two separate incidents on our network this morning which have led to delays: https://t.co/Ssj2lzz3Xm sorry for the delay this morning.

Customer: @SW_Help You really are terrible at your jobs.

There hasn't been a day without some sort of huge delay since you took over.

And I bet commuters get no void day refunds on our season tickets now, do we?

Customer: @SW_Help What would be really good is if, as well as making everyone late for work, you can make them late home tonight as well.

Get them nice and stressed at the end of a day.

That'd be great

Customer: @SW_Help Guard reckons we'll eventually be OVER TWENTY MINUTES LATE arriving!

You really don't care, do you?

We're just idiots who have to hand over silly money for awful service while you lot just laugh at us.

Customer: @SW_Help Could you just not be bothered running things properly today?

Delays at WAT.

Fantastic.

You suck

Customer: @SW_Help Is the 1841 wat-fnb train delayed?

Bet it is.

We're just trying to get home to our lives

Agent: @120742 Hi Nick, it is indeed.

Is this not being displayed on the information screens?

^MB

Customer: @SW_Help It was... eventually.

Maybe that's why I had to tweet you though?

It was less of a pain coming in via Reading during the strikes.

You're absolutely useless.
