Customer: @116072 why do you hate me?

Agent: @616965 I assure you we don't hate you.

If there's anything I can help you with, please send a DM with your account number.

Customer: @CenturyLinkHelp Scott, there isn’t anything that you could help me with.

You guys only provide 3mbps to my house.

That’s it.

Customer: @CenturyLinkHelp I try to do school work and I can’t do it.

I try to play Xbox with my friends and I can’t do it.

Customer: @CenturyLinkHelp I can’t do anything with the service your company provides... but sadly it’s the only option for me...

Agent: @616965 I apologize for that.

I can double check what services we provide at the address.

Customer: @CenturyLinkHelp Do you just need the address or still the account number?

Agent: @616965 To double check the services, I would just need the address.

You can send that in a DM, though, so it's not public.
