Agent: @617698 Hi.

We appreciate your patience.

Feel free to reach out to us if you ever need help with Windows 10 updates.

Customer: @MicrosoftHelps I would like warning that a given update won't be a quick reboot but will take 30+ minutes.

Then I could do it at a convenient time and not when I need to work.

Especially when it comes with "don't turn off your computer" warnings, on a laptop with limited battery life!

Agent: @617698 We hear you.

You have the option to schedule your updates.

Here's how: https://t.co/GCJk0Zw7xM.

Customer: @MicrosoftHelps wouldn't help in this situation.

Issue is that last night I hit "shut down and update" with no warning that it wasn't a usual 30-second update but that it would take 30-40 mins instead.

Needs a warning, *then* opportunity to schedule.

Customer: @MicrosoftHelps permenant schedule would also be asking for disaster - would turn on inside a closed bag in the night, do heavy duty update for 40 mins, potentially overheat.

Agent: @617698 We got you.
