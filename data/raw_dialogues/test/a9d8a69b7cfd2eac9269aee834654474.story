Customer: @MicrosoftHelps Yesterday i was using headphones on my HP laptop but today the headphones dont work on my computer anymore.

What's going on?

Agent: @396952 We're here to help, Samm!

Which version of Windows are you using?

Have you made any changes prior to this issue?

Customer: @MicrosoftHelps Windows 10, new computer in July/August.

No changes setting wise.

Paused the music and did leave the app open when i closed it.

Customer: @MicrosoftHelps When i have volume on the computer it is fine then plug in the headphones, it goes silent on the computer.

But no noise in headphones.

Customer: @MicrosoftHelps I went to the control panel and into 'sound' it shows the speakers but no heaphones like in the image.

That's where i get stuck..ðŸ˜•

Agent: @396952 Thanks for the details.

Were you able to try using a different headphone to check if it was your headphone having a problem?

Customer: @MicrosoftHelps Yes, tried them on a my phone and they work fine.

Agent: @396952 Have you tried updating all your drivers?

If not, try this link: https://t.co/0C8l3fjNZE.

Customer: @MicrosoftHelps Yes, I have tried that too and they are up-to-date.

Customer: @MicrosoftHelps Well, I just restarted the computer and now it works again.

Technology is fun...ðŸ˜” BUT talking via twitter compared to forum is way better!

Customer: @MicrosoftHelps Thank you for your help.

I'm sorry that technology has defeated me, yet again.

Lol.

Agent: @396952 Great!

You're right.

That's why we love twitter!
