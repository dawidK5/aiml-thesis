Customer: @sainsburys your store in The North Brentford Quarter often don't get deliveries of popular brands of cigarettes (Tuesdays and Thursdays).

Why?

When other branches always have them.

Agent: @151136 Sorry, could you DM us the brands you're looking for with the link below?

I'll have a check.

Customer: @sainsburys B&amp;H mainly Blue and Sky Blue, even the staff are fed up with it, not to mention your customers.

Agent: @151136 Hi there.

Is it the super king or king size that you buy?

Naomi

Customer: @sainsburys King size, they always have super king but never get the king size, also they seem to get deliveries of cigarettes that they are over stocked with and seldom sell.

Agent: @151136 Thanks.

Our system shows that 7 cases of Benson &amp; Hedges Blue King Size x20 and 3 cases of Benson &amp; Hedges Sky Blue King Size x 20 will be delivered tomorrow.

Hope you can get some next time you're in store.

Customer: @sainsburys We shall see if it continues.

I doubt that it will because the same situation has arisen many times before.

Customer: @sainsburys I have just been into the North Brentford Quarter store and guess what.

No Benson &amp; Hedges Blue or Sky Blue were delivered yesterday.

Maybe you need a new system or go back to using humans to order stock instead of a computer.

Agent: @151136 Really sorry about that, I've fed this back to the relevant department for further investigation.
