Customer: @AppleSupport “Trash” button on email notification does not work on latest iOS.

Agent: @137196 Thanks for reaching out about this issue.

What happens when you try to delete an email?

Do you get an error message?

Customer: @AppleSupport I don’t get an error and it does not go to trash.

Email still show up in inbox

Agent: @137196 Do you use the native Mail app or a third-party email app?

Which version of iOS are you running in Settings &gt; General &gt; About?

Customer: @AppleSupport iOS : 11.1.2 and I’m using native app

Agent: @137196 Alright, when did this start happening?

Are there any workarounds that you know of?

Like restarting the iPhone or closing the app in Multitasking?

Customer: @AppleSupport After upgrading to latest iOS , workaround is I  need to go to mailbox and trash it from there.

Agent: @137196 Let's look into that further.

Send us a DM and we'll go from there.
