Customer: @VirginTrains Can you give Coach C on the 18:20 Euston departure strobe lighting?

This is the party carriage!

#BrighterAwards

Agent: @473048 Glow sticks as well?

Customer: @VirginTrains Only balloon animals.

Can you provide the fun?

That's what Virgin is known for!

Agent: @473048 Ahhh mannn, is it a hen party?

^MW

Customer: @VirginTrains No, just a corporate awards ceremony.

You would make our day if you put strobe lighting in Coach C. Just about to leave Stoke, make our day!

Agent: @473048 I'll be honest, I'm not sure there's enough time.

However, flashlights on your phone, you know the rest!

^MW

Customer: @VirginTrains This is why we need you to provide the fun https://t.co/Png1gwmQlj

Customer: @VirginTrains Kicked in an hour ago, we still need your help!

Agent: @473048 I'm on my way Jake.

Get me a seat ready!

Customer: @VirginTrains Coach C. I'll buy you a gin and tonic!

Agent: @473048 Don't drink Gin, Jake.

If there's a cider going spare, I'm there.

After my shift of course 😉 ^MW

Customer: @VirginTrains You bring the strobes, I'll bring whatever you want 😉
