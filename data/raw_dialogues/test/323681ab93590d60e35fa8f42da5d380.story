Customer: @115858  @AppleSupport music and podcast “skip” around like a CD, then distorts and clears up in few seconds, only happens after iOS 11

Agent: @118095 We're here to help.

Did this happen after a specific update, or just recently?

Thanks!

Customer: @AppleSupport I noticed shortly after the first patch to iOS 11 not sure which one, but here in the past week or two it has gotten worse and more frequent

Customer: @AppleSupport It’s only done it with Apple Music and Apple Podcast, regardless if saved to phone or streaming
