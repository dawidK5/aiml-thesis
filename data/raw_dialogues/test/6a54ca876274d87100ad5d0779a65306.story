Customer: @Delta really?

My friend was just helping me out w/ a few xtra skymiles, &amp; you charged HIM a $130 transfer fee?

He's not even traveling.

He's just doing me a favor... c'mon!

Agent: @724929 Hi, Katharine, I'm sorry to hear we disappointed you.

There are fees involved to transfer miles from one account to another.

*TRR

Customer: @Delta So there's nothing you can do to help my friend out?

The only reason I didn't have enough miles in my account was cuz I already booked addtl trips w/ delta!

Agent: @724929 We cannot transfer miles here in reservations.

It can only be done online.

Customer: @Delta So where do I go online to help my friend get reimbursed?

Agent: @724929 I'm sorry, reimbursed for what?

Transfer of miles is done here:  https://t.co/4xtOgJnuyj *TMS

Customer: @Delta For Delta charging my friend for being a good guy &amp; making my dream trip possible!

He's not even traveling, &amp; the only reason I didn't have the miles needed was cuz I already booked other trips w/ Delta.

Agent: @724929 What he could have done, instead of transferring the miles, was purchase the ticket for you using his miles.

No need to transfer.

Customer: @Delta Why didn't your customer service representative suggest this option to me?

Agent: @724929 There may not have been enough miles in one account for the trip?

I cannot answer that properly since I was not privy to the conversation.

I can give you a place where you can send your concerns.

Customer: @Delta The agent did not ask about the miles available in my friend's account.

And he actually would have had enough miles.

Please do provide this place.

The bit.ly link you just included did not work.
