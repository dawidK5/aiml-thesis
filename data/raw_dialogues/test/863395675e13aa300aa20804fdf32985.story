Agent: @179120 Hi there, we're aware of the issue and our IT team are working on a fix as we speak.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Customer: @British_Airways The fact that you’re not all over this on social media and tweeting updates indicates you’ve not acknowledged the magnitude of yet ANOTHER BA IT failure.

ETA to fix??

?

Agent: @179120 We appreciate your frustration, however we're unable to provide you with a timescale.

Please be assured we're working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible and we can only apologise for any inconvenience this might have caused.

Customer: @British_Airways The Great British Non-Apology: "we apologise for any inconvenience this might have caused".

Firstly, it's more than a mere inconvenience, it's a major problem.

Secondly, at the very least you could have the decency and backbone to admit that it HAS caused, not MIGHT HAVE caused.

Customer: @British_Airways Your reply doesn't explain why there hasn't been a single proactive message from BA in your twitter feed about this issue.

With a problem of this magnitude and duration you should be giving us information &amp; updates, not only responding to incoming messages.

Proactive vs reactive.

Agent: @179120 If you need to order a meal we can certainly help you with that.

You'll need to DM us your full name, booking reference, email address and what number we can reach you on.

Customer: @British_Airways Since your reply comes 7 hours after I asked the question, we're now well beyond the 24h cut-off for in-flight meal ordering.

Thanks a bunch.
