Customer: @115858 we need another update I’m still seeing box’s with question marks on it..

Agent: @664381 iOS 11.1.1 should fix any autocorrect issues.

Are you seeing the error still when typing your own messages or viewing other people's messages?

Customer: @AppleSupport Like the question mark box error?

If so then yes I’m stilling seeing the error.

Agent: @664381 Please confirm if you are seeing it in things you are typing or things other people are typing.

Customer: @AppleSupport Other people are tying

Agent: @664381 The 11.1.1 update fixes the auto-correct issues on the device, but it won't fix seeing it on other forms of communication.

If you have other questions or concerns, please let us know.

We'll be glad to help.

Customer: @AppleSupport Well when is that gonna get fixed?

Agent: @664381 If you're still seeing the issue on other people's posts, then the issue can be resolved once they update to the latest iOS version; however, this will not remove the symbols shown on previous post or messages.
