Customer: So I pay for Amazon Prime membership to get my delivery on a nominated day (yesterday) and they outsourced the delivery to Hermes so are now saying they can’t gaurentee it will be delivered on the day they specified.

What exactly am I paying for please?

!

Agent: @151164 I'm so sorry your package is arriving later than expected!

Sometimes carrier capacity or other unforeseen circumstances may all affect your delivery date.

Have you been given a new delivery date?

Customer: @AmazonHelp Yes.

It was supposed to be today and it hasn’t arrived.

On the tracking it says there have been two delivery attempts but as I’ve been in my house and haven’t had a delivery or a card put through my door I know this isn’t true.

Customer: @AmazonHelp It’s nothing to do with capacity I expect the courier driver hasn’t actually attempted it or doesn’t know where he’s going.

Not really acceptable though as I pay money for Prime solely because you promise a specified delivery day.

Agent: @151164 Thank you for confirming!

Please contact us by phone or chat and we'll be happy to help investigate resolution options for you: https://t.co/JzP7hlA23B.

Please keep us posted!

We want to make sure this is fully resolved for you!

Customer: @AmazonHelp I’ve tried that.

The people at your call centre told me that as it’s with the courier there is nothing they can do.

Agent: @151164 Hi, I am sorry to hear this.

We strive to offer the best Black Friday and Cyber Week Deals.

During this time, deliveries may take slightly longer than usual.

What does the tracking currently say?.

^KK

Customer: @AmazonHelp This order was placed on the Thursday so I expect it would have been very quiet then actually.

The delivery says it was attempted yesterday and today but it hasn’t been as I took a day off work to be home for it.

It now says it will be redelivered Monday... when I’m back at work

Agent: @151164 Apologies, do you have unattended delivery preferences set on your account: https://t.co/EhJSNJJuZb?

Customer: @AmazonHelp Well it’s irrelevant if they’re going to the wrong house...

Agent: @151164 Please let us know if you don't receive your parcel by Monday.

We can deliver up until 21:00!

As ^SD mentioned, we want to make sure this is fully resolved for you.
