Customer: @GWRHelp I am on the 17:35 train to reading tonight from swindon heard tht the line is closed between the station just wanted to ask how my train will get through I c it is going to Chippenham first then to reading

Agent: @191126 correct via Chippenham, arriving Reading at 19:05 -Tony

Customer: @GWRHelp I assume it then goes on another line to reading?

Agent: @191126 yes, what we call the B &amp; H - Berks and Hants line passing through Melksham, Hungerford, Newbury Aldermaston and a few other places instead of the direct route via Didcot

Customer: @GWRHelp Something different

Agent: @191126 indeed, very scenic during daylight hours - Tony

Customer: @GWRHelp Just had a look at the route it's a very long way round haha

Agent: @191126 yes, it does add time to the journey unfortunately but useful while engineering works take place over the weekend and avoids the use of rail replacement busses especially as the M4 is closed between Jn 12 - Jn 13 this weekend with 1/2

Agent: @191126 a very long diversion route but by road - Tony

Customer: @GWRHelp That's fair enough at least I can just get on train at swindon then get off at reading instead of bus to didcot then train from didcot to reading its a lot easier

Agent: @191126 Thanks, hope you have a pleasant and safe journey - Tony
