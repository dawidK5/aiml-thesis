Customer: @Tesco found a whole live frog in a bag of shreddded lettuce before can i keep him or do you want him back ?

Agent: @270335 Hi Dan, wow!

That's an impressive find.

Unfortunately you will have to return this to an Extra/Metro/Superstore as we would have to return it to the suppliers for investigation.

I'm sorry for any disappointment this may cause.

Customer: @Tesco you arebn't going to kill him though are you ?

can i have him back ?

Agent: @270335 Hi Dan this is something that we are serious about investigating so if you're able to "hop" to a store with the frog and lettuce this will be highly appreciated.

Sorry, I cannot advise on whether you'll be allowed to keep the frog!

Customer: @Tesco can you find out if i can have him back 1st please ?

Agent: @270335 Hi Dan.

Our supplier would want to see him.

Therefore if you'd prefer to keep him I'm afraid we couldn't investigate further.

Thank you - Jennifer

Agent: @270335 Hi Dan, I'm glad to inform you that you won't have to pay any extra for your new flatmate.
