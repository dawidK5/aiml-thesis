Customer: Really disappointed with my @sainsburys home delivery tonight.

Most of the meat ordered goes out of date in the next 24-48 hours.

Customer: @sainsburys Will not be using again.

How is thisbgood meant to last the week?

Agent: @396432 Hi Tony, we sell products up to midnight of their expiry date to cut down on food waste.

Our drivers are obliged to wait while you...1/2

Agent: @396432 ...inspect your order.

Anything you're not happy with can be rejected for a full refund.

Customer: @sainsburys They did not offer this, in fact the driver didn't say 3 words to me.

I would have sent it all back.

Customer: @sainsburys And if I was shopping in store, I wouldn't have picked these items.

I thought home delivery was meant to be as fresh as you pick yourself

Customer: @sainsburys Can you guys do anything about this

Agent: @396432 Could you DM us the order number and account holder's name with the link below please?

We'll look into this.

Customer: @sainsburys I have already sorted this with your telephone team.

Couldn't wait 2 days for you guys to respond

Agent: @396432 Sorry about that Tony, we've been very busy.

I'm glad you got everything sorted though!
