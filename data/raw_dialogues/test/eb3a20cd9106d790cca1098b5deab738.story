Customer: Dear @Tesco #YouHadOneJob #Halloween2017 https://t.co/A0501NZKaW

Agent: @225903 Hi Sandy, the reason for this is because we need a few days advance notice to get the order in.

Customer: @Tesco Perhaps this should have been a week in advance of 31st instead of afterwards?

Agent: @225903 Hi Sandy, the days needed to order are advertised clearly, we always advise ordering in advance.

Sorry for any disappointment caused - Dani

Customer: @Tesco The point is you can't organise a Halloween cake for delivery before 31st October you can only get it on Nov 3?

So what is the point?

Agent: @225903 Hi Sandy, thanks for getting back to me.

I see what you mean here, where you'd be receiving the cake after Halloween.

Agent: @225903 The date changes, it shows 6 days from the date you sign in for preparation.

You'd have needed to order before 25th to get it for 31st.

Agent: @225903 I realise it'll be after Halloween at this point but it's available to order in case anybody wishes.

Kind regards - Ross 3/3
