Customer: @ArgosHelpers hi, I got this Panasonic SC-UA3 at Silverburn branch.

The instructions say it should have a moulded 3 pin mains plug.

This is definitely not the right one... https://t.co/KKwkxiOUAp

Agent: @258178 Hi Alexsandra, I am sorry if you are missing a part.

I have checked and we do not stock any spares for this item.

Agent: @258178 you would need to either return it to a store for assistance or contact the manufacturer for help (there should be a telephone number for them in the instructions).

Customer: @ArgosHelpers But I bought it from Argos not directly from the manufacturer.

All it's wrong with it is that it has a wrong plug for the UK which was sold in your shop.

Can a plug or an adaptor be supplied?

I can't return it as it's not convenient.

Thanks.

The manufacturer may be able to send you one out directly as it was missing from the box

Agent: @258178 .

Alternatively as you purchased direct from one of our stores you will need to return it to a store along with your receipt.

Customer: @ArgosHelpers It wasn't missing from the box.

The wrong one was in.

I can't return it as I don't drive &amp; won't book a taxi to take it back.

Argos could get it from the manufacturer.

Alternatively, Argos could offer to supply an adaptor to use for the UK.

What's your formal complaints route?

Agent: @258178 Hi Aleksandra.

Unfortunately as it's a stores purchase it will have to go back to store.

If you wish to complain please follow us and DM so we can forward you the details.

Thanks - David
