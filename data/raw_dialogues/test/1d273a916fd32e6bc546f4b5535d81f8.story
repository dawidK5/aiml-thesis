Customer: @ArgosHelpers hi, I was underpaid for August/September and I’m still not sure what’s going on.

I left in August.

Agent: @146679 Hi Robert I would advise to contact your previous Line Manager regarding this - Gee

Customer: @ArgosHelpers They have tried to contact payroll weeks ago and had no reply.

Unacceptable really.

Can’t just not pay people

Customer: @ArgosHelpers I have no way of contacting Argos to get my pay - Can you please provide a phone number or email address for someone senior.

Agent: @146679 Hi Robert did you work in store or in the CMC ?

- Will

Customer: @ArgosHelpers Hi, it was in store

Agent: @146679 You need to return to the store and speak with the manager so that they can get your pay issue resolved.

- Will

Customer: @ArgosHelpers I have already done that and they have said that they have had no response from payroll.

So I would like you to get me some contacts info.

Agent: @146679 Hi Robert, I am sorry you do need to chase with the store, they will need to contact them again for you.
