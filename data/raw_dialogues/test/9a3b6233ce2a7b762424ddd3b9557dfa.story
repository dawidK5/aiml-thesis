Customer: @Safaricom_Care does Mpesa have any delays?

I've been sent cash and I haven't got the message yet.

Agent: @350562 Hi.

Apologies for the challenge.

We have no issues reported with M-PESA services.

Did the one sending receive text message?

^AB

Customer: @Safaricom_Care Yes.

But none on my side

Agent: @350562 Then that is not M-PESA issue but SMS issue on your phone.

You can check M-PESA statement to confirm transactions ..

Customer: @Safaricom_Care My SMS's are working fine.

It hasn't reflected on my Acc.

Could you call sort this out?

Agent: @350562 .. in the absence of a text message.

If you use a dual-SIM handset take out the SIM card for a while for delayed SMS.

^AB

Customer: @Safaricom_Care This ain't working mate.
