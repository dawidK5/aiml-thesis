Customer: @AdobeCare Can you tell me how to do Red Eye Removal in Lightroom CC?

I just moved to it and don't see the Red Eye Removal tool.

Agent: @601573 Hi Bob, here is a link to show you to use the Red eye removal in Lightroom CC.

Customer: @AdobeCare Does not apply to the NEW LightRoom CC.

Any other suggestions?

Agent: @601573 Bob, I will loop in our Lightroom expert to help you with this.

The setting may have moved to a different location.

Agent: @601573 Hi Bob, Yes, its not there in Lightroom CC also, refer: https://t.co/ZYeB2O5W5f Thanks.

Customer: @AdobeCare Thank you.

I wish a list of feathers missing in Lightroom CC would have been noted before I migrated my library.

Never thought a commercial photo app from Adobe would omit a basic feature like that.

Agent: @601573 Hi Bob, this feature is not available in Lightroom CC as of now, however you may
suggest it as a feature here: https://t.co/gG3blhyPgB  .

Customer: @AdobeCare Hate to be “that guy” but this is a Photo Editing 101 feature.

Where is the list of what’s missing from the “new” Lightroom CC?

Customer: @AdobeCare Also, it would be great if https://t.co/3vVy5iS2Vg included “Lightroom CC” in its support system.

Only “PhotoShop Lightroom” is listed on that page.

So if I request it, I'd probably get back an "Already available" response.

Agent: @601573 We have released Lightroom Classic CC which has all the features the old Lightroom CC 2015.12 had, you can check this article to see the differences betweem LR Classic &amp; the new Lightroom CC: https://t.co/Cv0Aclaio3 .
