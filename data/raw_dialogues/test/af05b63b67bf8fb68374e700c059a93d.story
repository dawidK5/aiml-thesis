Customer: @ATVIAssist for some reason in the blackjacks gun game mode for blops 3, I keep being kicked for inactivity after 20 seconds of playing.

Agent: @712348 Hi there, Are you playing on a wireless connection?

If so, please use a wired connection and try again.

Customer: @ATVIAssist It was wired actually.

I double checked everything and it was all connected I believe.

But i’ll try again today and see if it was just me

Agent: @712348 Hey there, are you still being kicked out of matches for inactivity?

Customer: @ATVIAssist I’ll try hopping in a game right now and see!

Thanks for checking up on my issue!

Agent: @712348 For sure, if the issue continues send over a video of what you're encountering.
