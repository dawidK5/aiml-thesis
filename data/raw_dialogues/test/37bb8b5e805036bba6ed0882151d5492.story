Customer: @NikeSupport doing the 5K plan on the run app &amp; I’ve consistently done better/longer than the suggestions.

This morning it asked to update plan using my new (improved) times &amp; it cut next week’s runs by more than half &amp; slowed my times even more.

Why?

Agent: @791446 Let's figure this out.

Did you complete all workouts in your previous week in your Coach plan?

Customer: @NikeSupport Yes.

I haven’t missed a workout.

For example, today started week 5, I originally had a recovery run of 4.25 miles that was changed to 1.5 miles w/ a 2 min slower time.

The mileage total for this week dropped from 12.5 miles to 6.25 after the app updated based on my new data.

Agent: @791446 Got it.

Can you tell us what device, operating system and version of the app you're using?

Customer: @NikeSupport iPhone 7+ 
Version 11.1.2 
NRC App Version: 5.10.0 

Thanks!

Agent: @791446 Thanks for that information.

Mind passing us screenshots of what you're seeing?

Customer: @NikeSupport Sorry, screenshots of what exactly?
