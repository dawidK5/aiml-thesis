Customer: @GWRHelp when the whole train is full bar two nearly empty first class carriages, do you think a more flexible approach might be warranted?

Agent: @763973 Hello Gavin.

You'll need to speak to the Train Manager, this would be at their discretion.

Customer: @GWRHelp Perhaps they need to know that!

He was busy heading into the already full carriages

Agent: @763973 If First Class is declassified there will be announcement on-board to advise.

Customer: @GWRHelp Right.

So at what point (one station away from Paddington) does it make sense to announce that?

Those seats aren’t going to be taken where there’s no stops left but there were plenty of cramped passengers in cattle class!

Agent: @763973 It is a decision taken by the Train Manager based on conditions on-board.

As it effectively makes the carriage another standard class one, it doesn't happen every time there are no seats left.

Customer: @GWRHelp I think we're going round in circles - I'm simply asking what is the actual point of having two empty carriages on a packed train.

Guess it depends whether you want to please customers or not...

Agent: @763973 Apologies for the discomfort on your journey today Gavin, I'll record your feedback on declassification of First.

Phil.

Customer: @GWRHelp Thanks Phil.

Making sure the train managers know they can use their discretion would be a start too!
