Customer: @IHGService I wasted an hour earlier - the rate was on your site at 11am CST.

I called both the number you listed as well as the hotel directly.

Agent: @395016 1/2 Sorry about your disappointments.

I've called the hotel and spoke with an MOD, they confirmed that they never had that.

Agent: @395016 2/2 rate posted in any 3rd party site nor their website.

The lowest rate they had for the dates would 314.67 a night + tax.

Customer: @IHGService This was on the https://t.co/xPFwivFtQP website, not a 3rd party site.

When I contacted IHG, they would not honor rate.

False Advertising

Agent: @395016 We shared this to our hotel.

For immediately assist, it's best to call the hotel directly to clarify the rate you saw.^gc https://t.co/2rT0l9N9Cu

Customer: @IHGService As I stated, I called hotel &amp; main IHG #.

They both said they would not honor rate.

This is false advertising and should be honored.
