Customer: @UPSHelp I’m not DM’ing you because you’re a useless company every week I get a delivery from you and the lazy driver just gives the post office the items and then the app tells me they are gonna deliver the next day then 20 mins later says they’re at the post office

Agent: @696741 There is two service levels where we are required to deliver the packages from the shipper to the Post Office and they take care of the final delivery.

One is Surepost and the other is Mail Innovations.

Customer: @UPSHelp Well isn’t that 3 service levels?

And why did my app say you attempted to deliver my package when you clearly didn’t.

Absolute joke

Agent: @696741 1.

Surepost 2.

Mail Innovations.

We will need the tracking number for that package to look into it further.

If you DM us that information we can check into it for you.

Customer: @UPSHelp So surepost is where your shit company just gets your drivers to drop off everyone’s parcels at the post office?

I didn’t trust your shit app and went to go collect my item today and they didn’t have it 20 mins later they did when on the app it said it was coming tomorrow

Agent: @696741 Surepost is a contracted service where we deliver the package from the shipper to USPS for them to do the final delivery.

If you do want help we will need the tracking number to see what specifically is going on.
