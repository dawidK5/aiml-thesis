Customer: @British_Airways You want to charge me £900 to cancel 2 flights that I don't want to use otherwise you cancel my 4th flight and £4200 to change them #RIPOFF

Agent: @476709 Hi Hannah.

The price for rebooking and transforming return flights in one-way tickets, have to be re-priced 1/2

Agent: @476709 based on current availability and ticket rules.

Sorry if the cost es higher than you expected.
