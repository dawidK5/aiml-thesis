Customer: @AppleSupport Siri do t work on IPhone 8plus.

Any help

Agent: @248326 Let's see what we can do to get your virtual assistant back to working order.

Can you tell us what happens when you try to use Siri?

Which iOS version are you using?

Also, when did you first notice this issue?

That'll help us get started.

Customer: @AppleSupport The newest one.

Two weeks ago.

I have disabled and then started again.

So I go through the process of my voice with Siri and it says ready to use.

I lock phone and say Hey Siri and nothing.

Agent: @248326 Let's help make sure everything is set right.

Do you currently have "Allow Siri When Locked" enabled under Settings &gt; Siri &amp; Search?

If not, please enable the feature and then test Siri to see if the behavior continues.

Customer: @AppleSupport Yes it’s enabled.

Agent: @248326 Thanks for those details.

Just to make sure, what iOS version is currently installed?

To find out, navigate to: Settings &gt; General &gt; About.

Are you able to invoke Siri in any other way?
