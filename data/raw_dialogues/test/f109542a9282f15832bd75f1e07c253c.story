Agent: @155972 Hi there, in order to receive the $29 rate, your companion would have to be traveling in the same reservation as you.

Customer: @Delta wait - what rate???

https://t.co/KLFKPL8YS9 states that Platinum get one guest...

I want to know what kind of ticket does the guest need...

Agent: @155972 It's not a matter of the what kind of ticket, the passenger must be traveling under the same pnr (reservation) as you.

I am really... 1/2

Agent: @155972 ...sorry for the inconvenience.

*HSD 2/2

Customer: @Delta but we do agree there's no fee then?

too bad for the guest.

Just moved from OneWorld, where the guest just needs to travel OneWorld...

Agent: @155972 Could you please follow/DM your confirmation number so I can have more details?
