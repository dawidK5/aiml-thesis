Customer: @Delta it would have been really nice when I booked my ticket to get a heads up that my purchase ONLY allowed a middle seat.

That's what they're telling me here at the gate in Atlanta, anyway... ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I'm a traveler who reads the fine print, so this is disappointing

Agent: @427759 Hi Hadas, none of our tickets restrict you to middle seats only.

If available, you should be able to move to a window or aisle.

I'm sorry for the incorrect information.

Please DM your confirm # and I can see if there is another seat to move to.

Customer: @Delta I'll pull up your reply if I ever run into a similar issue.

There were empty seats on the flight, and I moved.

It seems that your gate agent simply didn't feel like making the effort to find me another seat.

DL 1105 from Atlanta today.

Thanks for replying.

Customer: @Delta And for the record - she told me flat out that the ticket I purchased allowed for middle seats only.

Agent: @427759 I am very sorry that you were told the wrong information.

I'm glad you were able to move but I apologize that the agent did not assist you with this.

I will forward this to Atlanta Leadership so they are aware of the incident.

We are always here on Twitter to help, too.

Customer: @Delta Thank you!

Agent: @427759 You are welcome.

Have a wonderful week.

Customer: @Delta You too.

Glad to hear the policy is not what I was told.

Agent: @427759 Moving forward, I hope it will be a better experience for you for your seating arrangements the next time, Hadas.

We value your patronage with us.

Best to you and your travels that are coming!
