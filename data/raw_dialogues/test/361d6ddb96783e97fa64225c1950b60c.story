Customer: @SpotifyCares Webplayer been stuck on this ad even after refresh, restart, re-log in and trying on different computer, it's chrome on win 10 https://t.co/OOyAtWYkWi

Agent: @210049 Hey, that doesn't look right.

Can you try clearing your browser's cache and cookies?

Let us know how it goes /JE

Customer: @SpotifyCares Just did both and still stuck on that same southern comfort ad :(

Agent: @210049 Hmm, that's odd.

Do you have the latest version of Chrome?

If not, we'd suggest updating it.

Keep us posted /JE

Customer: @SpotifyCares yes, in my about page it says up to day, specifically "Version 61.0.3163.100 (Official Build) (64-bit)" if that helps~

Agent: @210049 Got it.

Can you try accessing https://t.co/aT5o0wcN4V using a private or incognito window?

Fingers crossed that'll do the trick /JE

Customer: @SpotifyCares Just tried with an incognito and logs into the same issue, it's still stuck on southern comfort ad forever ðŸ˜‚, thanks for keeping up w/ this

Agent: @210049 Sure, we're always here to help!

If possible, can you check if the same thing happens when accessing https://t.co/aT5o0wcN4V on Firefox?

/JE

Customer: @SpotifyCares I don't have firefox but i did try it on Edge and it's the same issue, so it doesn't seem to be chrome specific

Agent: @210049 In this case, can you send us your account's email address or username via DM?

We'll carry on there /JE https://t.co/ldFdZRiNAt
