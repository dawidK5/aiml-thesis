Customer: Oh @Delta ....

Sorry, not sorry is the worst answer to give a customer.

And I would agree, it IS an "act of god" that there was ice in 45 degree weather in FL.

**Ice freezes at 32degrees** Still waiting 3 flights later.

Agent: @802404 Hi, Aimee.

What flight are you referring to?

I would like to take a look.

*AJL

Customer: @Delta DL 1234.

It says "de-icing" but the pilot let us know once maintenance got there, they found no ice.

Missed DL 801, missed standby on the overbooked DL 2335, now waiting for flight 1765.

Missed all mtgs by now.

My "compensation" I was told was moving my seat from row 43 to 29.

Customer: @Delta .....uh....hello?

Agent: @802404 Hello!

How may I help you?

Customer: @Delta Well I already replied to one rep and haven't heard back....

Agent: @802404 Hi, Aimee.

My sincere apologies for the delayed response.

I am reviewing the details for the delay on DL1234.

*AJL

Agent: @802404 The flight history does indicate the delay was for deicing.

Do you have additional information from the pilot what the maintenance was for?

*AJL

Customer: @Delta The pilot announced over the speaker that he apologized for the delay maintenance took to get there and that once they checked out the wings, there was in fact no ice.

Once we were able to taxi, he announced we'd have to wait another 5 mins for takeoff line up.

Agent: @802404 Aimee, all delays are frustrating and I'm sorry that you were affected.

We'll try to have you on your way asap.

*TLT

Customer: @Delta Not a great response for what took me 3 flights to try to get where I should've been...especially when it means missed meetings and loss of business.

I'm sure Delta wouldn't be happy about that either.
