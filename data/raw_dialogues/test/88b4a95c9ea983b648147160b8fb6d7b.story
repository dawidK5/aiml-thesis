Apologies again for your experience.

They are able to assist with adding your bag.

Customer: @Delta I've been trying to get in touch with them since 8 am.

Now it's a 29 minute wait!

Agent: @216496 Sorry for the frustration with adding a bag.

I would suggest you do this at the airport at the Kiosk or at the bag drop with an agent.
