Agent: @703719 Thanks for the picture.

So you're saying you're not able to claim Games with Gold games unless it's from an Xbox 360?

What page are you trying to access when you get the error in the photo?

Are you able to properly load up this page: https://t.co/twzrENZeEu?

Customer: @XboxSupport I dont have  Xbox 360 im using an Xbox One and yes im able to load up that page but the error begins at the moment of complete purchase not only with games with gold for 360 but also for Xbox 360 games backward compatibility which are not for free    (there is a credit card added

Agent: @703719 Ah, gotcha.

Have you tried making the purchase on multiple browsers as well?

I went as if I was going to purchase and Xbox 360 game here and didn't run into any troubles.
