Customer: @AppleSupport AirPods are connected but don’t play audio anymore any troubleshooting tips?

Agent: @123068 We can certainly take a look!

To begin, does this occur with all devices or just one?

Customer: @AppleSupport iPad and iPhone

Agent: @123068 Alright, can you tell us what iOS version you're currently on?

Also, have you tried unpairing and pairing your AirPods again?

Customer: @AppleSupport iPad 11.0.3 iPhone 11.0.3 and yes I have tried unpairing and issue still persisted

Agent: @123068 We'd recommend creating a backup of the data on both devices and updating to iOS 11.1.

Please let us know if this helps.

Customer: @AppleSupport That fixed it

Agent: @123068 Great.

Let us know if you have any further questions or concerns.

We're happy to help.
