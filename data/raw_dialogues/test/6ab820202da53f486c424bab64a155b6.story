Customer: @sprintcare @115714 #Sprint Absolutely HORRIBLE customer service and from a so-called "supervisor" at that.

Agent: @446636 This concerns us.

Customer service is one of our main priorities.

Please allow us to turn this around.

Customer: @sprintcare REALLY - Haven't seen GOOD customer service since the day I signed up back in 2000 - I don't think longtime customers is a "priority"

Customer: @sprintcare Just got hung up on after a 1:24 call -- 75% was on hold including the last 30 minutes.

people need to stay away from @115714

Agent: @446636 Please DM us to talk about this.

I'd be more than able to provide feedback on the agent that placed you on hold for so long.
