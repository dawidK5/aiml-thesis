Customer: @Tesco trying to order online, but apparently need to resent my password.

But the password reset email never arrives.

Help?

Agent: @537180 Have you checked your junk or spam email?

:) Ty - James

Customer: @Tesco Yep, I've also monitored the inbound MTA after making the reset requests and no mail from Tesco even gets as far as our mail servers.

Customer: @Tesco Are you able to update my email address to something else so I can try that?

Agent: @537180 Hi there.

Please DM your full name, address and email so I may look into this.

Customer: @Tesco I've done that.

Was hoping to place my order tonight; that's not looking likely.

Maybe @sainsburys can satisfy my shopping needs...

Agent: @537180 Hi, I have replied to your DM.

TY - Chris

Customer: @Tesco All good now, thanks.

Sorry Saino's :-P

Agent: @537180 Glad to hear that :) If there's anything else please get in touch.

Regards - James
