Customer: @115725 Y does Verizon make it so dif’cult 2 contact a live human?

Need an issue resolved.

Can’t get thru.

It’s about FIOS &amp; home service.

Agent: @298608 We can assist you here  ^CAR

Customer: @VerizonSupport Trying to find out which model of routers from third parties are viable for use with Verizon Fios internet and cable?

Agent: @298608 You can use any router for your internet, but for TV service you must use our router.

^CAR

Customer: @VerizonSupport What is the make and model of your router?

And, ANY router is good for internet WITH the Verizon router?

Agent: @298608 Our router is just a standard Ethernet router with a Moca port for TV service and some software tweaks to optimize it for our service.

^KMG

Customer: @VerizonSupport So, are you suggesting that it is IMPOSSIBLE to purchase a router from ANY other source BUT Verizon that will provide service to the home?

Agent: @298608 No!

Purchase your own router for internet use.

However, it will not be able to populate your TVGuide or On Demand functions.

Customer: @VerizonSupport You CAN’T recommend a router that would populate the TV guide &amp; On Demand functions, or you won’t!?

On the ones you sell/lease will!

?

Agent: @298608 Only a Verizon provided router would populate your TVguide and On Demand.

Any other 3rd party will not however the internet will work!
