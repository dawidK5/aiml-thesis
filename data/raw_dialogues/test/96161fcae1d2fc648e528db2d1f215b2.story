Customer: @115890 @MicrosoftHelps when updating word (or any MS app) for iOS, why don't you show me a changelog?

Where can I see changes?

Customer: @115890 @MicrosoftHelps I don't think a vague message and an advertisement for O365 is relevant for the update notes section.

Agent: @290959 Good question!

Update notes can be found on where you downloaded the Office app.

Let us know if you have other questions.

Customer: @MicrosoftHelps Sorry, I don't understand.

All I can see is what is pictured in the screenshot from the previous tweet.

Agent: @290959 Hmm.

Let's go back to Microsoft Word app.

On the right side, click on Version History.

Scroll down to see the changes log.

Customer: @MicrosoftHelps I can see version numbers, but not actual changes.

The last time that actual changes were documented was 1.28 on the 12th of Dec 2016. https://t.co/tRTMVvwsCN

Agent: @290959 Got this.

Just to clarify, what are the extension of the files that you've opened?

Are they on .pdf format?

Customer: @MicrosoftHelps Why is the file format relevant?

I'm in the App Store.

I normally open .docx files
