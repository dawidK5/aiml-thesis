Customer: @SpotifyCares You guys mixed up songs.

Breezeblocks by Alt-J has been replaced with their other song Fitzpleasure.

Both play the same song!

Agent: @124511 Hey Angie!

Can you send us the Song Link?

Just tap the three dots &gt; Share &gt; Copy Link.

We'll check it out /SY

Customer: @SpotifyCares https://t.co/s5wVyP2vKf labeled as Breezeblocks but is actually Fitzpleasure https://t.co/gpvecBA8UJ
Thanks so much!

Customer: @SpotifyCares https://t.co/tGbLK4aErF This is what Breezeblocks should sound like!

Just to make your job easier.

Agent: @124511 Hmm, everything looks good on our end.

Can you tell us the country that your account is set to?

/SY

Customer: @SpotifyCares I am listening from the United States and my account is set in the U.S. as well.

Hope that helps.

Agent: @124511 1: That's odd.

We've taken a closer look and the track plays the correct song.

Can you tell us what device, operating system, and...

Agent: @124511 2: version of Spotify you're using?

We'll lend a hand /SY
