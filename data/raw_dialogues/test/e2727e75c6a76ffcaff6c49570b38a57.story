Agent: @201284 Hi Tom, i'm sorry that your flight has been cancelled.

Can I check which service you were due to take with us?

^BM

Customer: @VirginAtlantic Due to fly from Orlando today to Gatwick at 18.25 now 19.50.

I spent extra money booking the early flight

Agent: @201284 Hi Tom, I have replied to your Facebook private message.

Thank you ^BM

Customer: @VirginAtlantic Not with a satisfactory response just speak to customer services and get nowhere and nothing!

Why can I still book tickets online?

?

Customer: @VirginAtlantic How can you charge for a service your not providing?

Agent: @201284 I've just double checked our website and we're only selling seats on our VS16 service this evening ^E

Customer: @VirginAtlantic You weren't when we were told.

No text or email to notify.

Ruined the holiday and missing appointments now on return.

Customer: @VirginAtlantic How are you compensating affected customers?

?

Agent: @201284 Please follow this link to details on compensation in line with EU regulations: https://t.co/yjwmx5mIhm ^H

Customer: @VirginAtlantic Big company response with shocking service.

Can't sell enough seats to fulfil the flight is your problem not mine.

Customer: @VirginAtlantic What about compensation for soaked cases and everything inside soaked/ruined?

?

Agent: @201284 So sorry to hear this Tom, have you been in contact with our baggage services?

^R

Customer: @VirginAtlantic No do you have the details?

Agent: @201284 I've just replied to your Facebook message with contact info ^R

Customer: @VirginAtlantic It can take 28 days for a response from the contact details you provided that is not acceptable customer service!

Agent: @201284 28 days is worse case, you should hear much sooner than this but they will need some time to investigate ^R

Customer: @VirginAtlantic I can ring the water out of my clothing that is just ridiculous!
