2/2 ^Cody

Customer: @British_Airways Cody I can send an inter EU payment in minutes, I don’t understand what the delay is.

I expect you to make  a further gesture of goodwill given the unacceptable delay in paying mandatory compensation.

Agent: @223618 We understand why you'd ask for an additional gesture becuase you're waiting a while for us to settle your claim.

However, it's not something we can offer, We are sorry.

We do appreciate your patience.^Linda W

Customer: @British_Airways Still waiting .

You can take my money for flights in seconds but when you are OBLIGED to pay customers you have maltreated you chose to delay payments!!

Customer: @British_Airways That’s the same message I’ve heard for nearly two weeks .

If you have sent the funds to the wrong account that is not my issue.

send a payment without delay.

I shouldn’t be inconvenienced further due to your ineptitude .

You are in breach of EC261/2004

Customer: @British_Airways I am currently raising a formal complaint under CEDR and also the EU Commission Dispute Resolution Service.

Your disdain for the regs which stipulate timely payment of compensation is shocking.

Agent: @223618 I fully understand how disappointing this has been for you, John.

I'm sincerely sorry we're unable to speed this process up and I do hope this is resolved for you soon.

^Kev

I ask again, send an immediate payment as per your obligations.

Customer: @British_Airways Any input appreciated Mr Cruz!
