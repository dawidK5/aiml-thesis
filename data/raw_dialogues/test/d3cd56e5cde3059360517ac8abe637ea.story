Customer: @nationalrailenq And you’re charging more because of the storm?

Agent: @327002 We cannot predict how much damage the storm is going to cause so we cannot guarantee your service will run.

Customer: @nationalrailenq I appreciate that - the trains struggle with a light breeze so a storm is asking a lot.

I’ll have to take my chances :/ thank you
