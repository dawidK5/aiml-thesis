Customer: @AppleSupport since the update to IOS 11 my phone doesn’t perform as it should, I’ve reset and restored but it still runs slow or turns off

Agent: @430820 We'd be happy to look into this with you.

Can you tell us which iPhone and version of iOS 11 you're using?

Customer: @AppleSupport 6s plus, iOS 11.0.3

Agent: @430820 Thanks for this.

Can you let us know when you are noticing these behaviors the most?

During the use of apps?

Customer: @AppleSupport during app and not during app use, sometimes apps don't work or freeze, apps don't install properly or don't open after being downloaded

Customer: @AppleSupport slow to upload web pages, emails.

when the phone goes to sleep it sometimes comes back on without me touching it.

Agent: @430820 Got it.

Are you keeping regular backups in iTunes or iCloud of your iPhone?

Also, have you removed and reinstalled the apps?

Customer: @AppleSupport Back up quite frequently, this is only started since the update

Agent: @430820 Got it.

Let's continue in DM.
