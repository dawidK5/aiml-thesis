Customer: @115888 Hey, why won't the Tom Petty solo albums/songs start when pressing play anymore?

My Petty playlist is ruined.

RUINED, I TELL YOU.

Agent: @558798 Hey!

Help's here.

Can you let us know what device, operating system, and Spotify version you're rocking?

We'll see what we can suggest /RA

Customer: @SpotifyCares Great, thanks: IPhone 6+ , IOS10.3.3 , Spotify version 8.4.22.515

Agent: @558798 Got it!

Could you send us a screenshot of the exact error message you're getting every time you try to play his tracks?

/RA

Customer: @SpotifyCares No message, just doesn't respond when pressing the solo songs.

They get skipped when playing the playlist.

A license thing, perhaps?

Agent: @558798 That's odd!

Could you try restarting your device?

Let us know how it goes /RA
