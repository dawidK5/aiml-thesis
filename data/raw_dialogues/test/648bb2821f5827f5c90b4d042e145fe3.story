Agent: @129717 (2/2) Pitney Bowes.

Opening a return will be required for a refund, but you should expect a complete refund for this.

Customer: @AskeBay but you are hiding from accountability And my intel from other users is that EGS returns &amp; refunds do no happen

Customer: @AskeBay and since I cannot tell if Seller or #PitneyBowes packaged this item this way, how can I leave feedback?

I cannot neg a #EGSseller

Agent: @129717 1/2 It’s rare when Pitney Bowes has to repackage items because of original packaging issues, but you’re still covered.

If ^LL

Agent: @129717 2/2 the items were damaged we’re able to help by having you open a return request.
