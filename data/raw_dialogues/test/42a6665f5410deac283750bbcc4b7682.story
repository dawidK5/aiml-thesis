Customer: @Tesco https://t.co/Iih8XwmMDg

Agent: @740448 Hi Shenman, they should be inside the packaging.

Please contact the game creators.

They should be able to advise further with it not being inside - Allyn

Customer: @Tesco but as pre-order how would retailers know which product to hand out to pre-orders as all look same?

@116089 @141157 can U shed light?

Customer: @Tesco @116089 @141157 @127852  can you 'help'?

Agent: @740448 Hiya, having worked in a store myself, I can tell you that any pre-order games come in a separate delivery to the main stock we will sell.

This is to avoid those who made a pre-order not getting the new game as soon as it is released.

TY

Customer: @Tesco thanks but I checked and they only had one version of the game.

No distinction between pre order and regular stock?

Customer: @Tesco so if I follow the logic here I was given the wrong copy?

If your staff new nothing off the promotion (which they didn't) then they

Customer: @Tesco may have been giving out the pre-order copies to people who were just buying the regular game?

I'm not trying to be awkward

Customer: @Tesco but I would just like what I was sold and what I actually paid in advance for.

There must be some way of supplying your customers

Customer: @Tesco correctly.

I was told by staff in store that if you order via Direct they email the codes.

So surely it must be possible for you to

Customer: @Tesco supply them to me that way?

It would be nice to think Tesco care about resolving things like this for their customers and doing

Customer: @Tesco what is fair and correct.

Agent: @740448 Hi there, I've spoken to my Support Team to confirm, and they've advised that you would need to speak to EA.

TY.
