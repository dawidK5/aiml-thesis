Customer: @hulu_support My watchlist is not updating with new episodes (past couple days).

Any idea why?

Agent: @658975 Apologies for the trouble, Norlene!

We're looking into this.

In the meantime, try navigating to the season / episode manually.

Customer: @hulu_support Tried logging out/back in, that didnâ€™t help

Agent: @658975 Sorry!

ðŸ˜” We assure you that our team is working hard to investigate, and we hope to have a fix ready soon!

Customer: @hulu_support Thank you!

Some shows updated overnight, but others did not...

Agent: @658975 We definitely understand, Norlene.

For now, we recommend checking the show page for these shows as the new eps will be there

Customer: @hulu_support As of this morning, the problem seems to be resolved.

Watchlist updated overnight with all new episodes.

Thank you for your attention to this matter!

I love Hulu ðŸ’š

Agent: @658975 Awesome!
