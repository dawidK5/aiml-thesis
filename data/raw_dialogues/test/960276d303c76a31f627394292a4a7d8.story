Customer: Holding for over an hour, @115722.

Agent: @529736 Not sure why you are on hold there but we are here for you.

What's got you calling in?

Customer: @VerizonSupport Canâ€™t get service on the TV.

Havenâ€™t had it for weeks, but every time I call I ultimately hang up because I canâ€™t get anyone on the line.

Agent: @529736 Oh no!

Are there any lights on your box?

What happens when you turn on the TV?

Customer: @VerizonSupport Pixelated picture, no sound, and the signal goes in and out.

Itâ€™s unwatchable.

Agent: @529736 Is this happening on all the TVs?

Customer: @VerizonSupport We only have one.

ðŸ˜Š

Agent: @529736 Is this any specific channel or all channels?

^RMD

Customer: @VerizonSupport All channels.

Agent: @529736 Disconnect the coax from the back of the box where it says FIOS TV IN, and then reconnect.

Let us know if that helps.

Customer: @VerizonSupport I donâ€™t have a box, just local channels.

Customer: @VerizonSupport I think I am on hold now to cancel the service.

They canâ€™t seem to help me, and Iâ€™m paying for a service Iâ€™m not receiving.ðŸ˜¢

Agent: @529736 We don't offer support unless you have a box.

You can try swapping out the COAX cable screwed in, but we can't test anything.

Customer: @VerizonSupport Well, Iâ€™ve now been on trying to change services and theyâ€™re jerking me around.

Iâ€™m going to lose my mind.

This is my entire evening.
