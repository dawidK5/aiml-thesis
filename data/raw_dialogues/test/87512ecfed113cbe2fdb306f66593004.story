Customer: @hulu_support it seems like since th last update volume on the Apple TV has gone down.

So we have to turn it up more.

This is on all our TVs

Agent: @128399 That's odd behavior!

Which generation Apple TV do you have?

Are you noticing lower volume on all content or a certain show/movie?

Customer: @hulu_support Sorry for not replying.

It was mostly CBS and other random ones.

But seems to be better and back to normal now.

Agent: @128399 Apologies for the delay on our end!

We're so glad to hear things seem to be back to normal!

Let us know if this happens again.

Customer: @hulu_support Well it seems like some CBS shows are quieter then other shows/channels.

Not sure what happened again.

Agent: @128399 Thanks for following up!

If you let us know which shows, and which generation Apple TV you have, we'll take a closer look.

Customer: @hulu_support 4th gen Apple TV 2 of them.

Kevin can wait was one of them and it seems most CBS shows at time can be quieter.

Agent: @128399 Is the audio lower all throughout playback or does it decrease at a certain point?

Let us know if: https://t.co/56JXI4vxlf helps.

Customer: @hulu_support Throughout.

It seems random on what shows and when it happens.

Almost like it comes and goes.

But always CBS shows.
