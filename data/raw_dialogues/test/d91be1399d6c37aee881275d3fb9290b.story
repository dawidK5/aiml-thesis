Customer: @Delta OK but website is where I turn to simply check flight status.

Seems odd it is not working.

Am picking up Delta passengers and use the website to check flight status.

Agent: @790586 Hi.

What Delta Flight are you trying to track status for?

Agent: @790586 I just went to the website on my personal tablet, and the website is pulling up any Delta Flight that I type in.
