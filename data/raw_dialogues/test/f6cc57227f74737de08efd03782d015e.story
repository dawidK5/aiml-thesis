Customer: Stuck at Staines waiting for a Reading train, why no information or advice being passed on to passengers on the platform?

@SW_Help

Agent: @507897 Hi, due to electric supply problems trains are not running to Reading.

Customer: @SW_Help I know the reason, but I don't think it unreasonable to have announcements or staff giving updates.

E.g the 8.42 was going to Wokingham it is now going to Reading.

Why wasn't this announced?

Agent: @507897 Hi, no trains are currently able to run to Reading.

Customer: @SW_Help Yeah I can see it has changed back to Wokingham again.

Customer: @SW_Help So what's the excuse for now terminating this train at Ascot.

This is appalling!

Customer: @SW_Help And you change your mind again and open the line.

Agent: @507897 Hi Adrian, we have just been informed by @115793 engineers that the line is open again and trains can now run between Wokingham and Reading.

Sorry for the confusion.
