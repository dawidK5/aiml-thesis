Customer: @Tesco please bring security back to the Hall Green store.

The store is getting a more an more uncomfortable vibe, not alone on this either!

Agent: @471404 Hi there, sorry to be a pain but can you confirm which Hall Green store this is?

TY - Reece

Customer: @Tesco It's the Hall Green store right next to the train station.

Hoping you haven't removed security from the others too now...

Agent: @471404 Hi, can you please confirm what you mean by "uncomfortable vibe"?

- Nick

Customer: @Tesco Well there's pretty obvious shop lifters regularly, and today we had a man clearly intoxicated screaming and randomly asking people things.

Agent: @471404 Thanks for taking the time to provide these details, can you just confirm its the Express store?

TY-Phil

Customer: @Tesco Yes the express store!

Thanks aswell.

I'd review the CCTV from when security were removed.

If customers can see the changes you will too!

Agent: @471404 Hi there.

I have spoken to the store.

They have had a few problems recently and are looking into improving security.

Thanks - Ian

Customer: @Tesco Thank you again.

I often worry for the staff as it is becoming a hot spot for undesirables.

The homeless aren't the issue to save confusion!

Agent: @471404 Hi there, thank you for bringing this to our attention the last thing we want is our customers to feel unsafe.

Thank you - Brooke

Customer: @Tesco No thank you for taking it seriously ðŸ˜Š here's hoping the store gets back to normal soon!

Agent: @471404 Hi there, I'm glad one of my colleagues has dealt with the issue.

Enjoy the rest of your weekend - Rian
