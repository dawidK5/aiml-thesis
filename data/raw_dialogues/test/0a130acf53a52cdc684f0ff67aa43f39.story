Customer: The new @115858 update made it so my car canâ€™t control my @115888.

Agent: @460751 We'd like to help.

Is the issue isolated only to that app, or does this happen with other music apps as well?

Customer: @AppleSupport My car only can control @115948 even when the app isnâ€™t open.

Is your iPhone updated to the latest version of iOS 11.0.3?

Agent: @460751 Thank you.

Also, if you go into the App Store, does it show you have any app updates available?
