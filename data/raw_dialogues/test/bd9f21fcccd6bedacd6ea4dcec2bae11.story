Agent: @277428 That's not good, does resetting the box help when you run into this error message?

Customer: @CoxHelp Sadly it doesn’t.

:(

Agent: @277428 Have you swapped out the box for this issue previously?

We can have a tech come out to do some more troubleshooting?

~Derrick

Customer: @CoxHelp We still have our original box

Agent: @277428 Hi, I'd like to confirm are you not able to watch any channels at all or please when this message appears?

Thanks,  -Carol https://t.co/ovAKPb0TYC

Customer: @CoxHelp I get it when I try to watch stuff on demand.

It’s not all the time, but most of the time.

Agent: @277428 Please disconnect the power cord for a full 5 mins.

Then try to order or watch something on OnDemand.

Should you get the same error message we can send a signal from the office.

Agent: @277428 Thereafter, if the error still occurs we'll need to schedule a service appointment for a Field Tech to check things out - it's possible your box may need to be swapped.

Let us know what happens.

Thanks,  -Carol   (2/2)

Customer: @CoxHelp Great!

I’ll give it a try in the am and let you know how it goes!

Agent: @277428 Ok keep us posted.

We're available daily on Twitter, 24/7.

Thanks -Karen
