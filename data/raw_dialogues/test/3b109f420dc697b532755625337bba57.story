Customer: @SouthwestAir Is your site really undergoing maintenance or am I just having issues on my own logging in to buy tickets for a few hrs?

Thnx!

Agent: @308792 We aren't aware of any technical issues with our website at the moment, Amy!

Should the issue continue, please reach us at 800-435-9792!

Customer: @SouthwestAir Thanks!

I can login on my app but it isn't letting me add my wife's name to a flight I want to buy her w/ my points.

Is this an app thing?

Agent: @308792 You may need to book her separately if you're booking with points!

Customer: @SouthwestAir Thanks - I am only trying to book her ticket.

The passenger info is populated and won't let me change it b/c it doesn't match RR#.

Agent: @308792 Hmm - You may need to book through the website or by calling our Reservations Team.

We'll let our Technology Team know of your issue!

Customer: @SouthwestAir Ok.

I will attempt to login to the website again.

I am not in America right now, so calling won't work.

Thanks!

Agent: @308792 If the website doesn't work, feel free to DM us if we can lend a hand!
