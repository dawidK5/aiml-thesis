Help?

Agent: @531921 Sorry to hear that!

Please turn off the console and disconnect all the cables from it for 3 minutes, then try again.

Customer: @AskPlayStation Ok tried that.

No go.

Any other ideas?

Agent: @531921 Please try to start your console in safe mode and choose option 4 Rebuild Database: https://t.co/ZkUK91RWMl

Customer: @AskPlayStation That link is for ps3 does it work the same for ps4?

Agent: @531921 Sorry for the confusion.

Here is the right one: https://t.co/OOaq76kzAA Option 5.

Customer: @AskPlayStation Can’t do safe mode.

No power at all
