Customer: @hulu_support Current version of your Hulu app for Amazon FireTV has sound that is half a second or more delayed from video, even after cache clearing and other troubleshooting.

Please tell me it's being fixed soon.

It's been weeks now.

Agent: @240428 Apologies, Mark!

Let's confirm we've gone through: https://t.co/TR6ei0cnf1.

Customer: @hulu_support Did the cache clearing, and will try uninstall reinstall this evening.

Agent: @240428 Sounds like a plan!

Thanks again for being willing to troubleshoot with us.

We'll be on standby for the results.

Customer: @hulu_support I tried uninstall/reinstall, so I have been through all the troubleshooting steps.

Problem seemed worse actually.

There is a hulu uservoice where others are reporting this as well on Fire TV.

I suspect it needs a bug fix.

Customer: @hulu_support See this:  https://t.co/mYhTbBINnx.

Customer: @hulu_support A month of my subscription fee has now been wasted trying to watch video with this audio delay on your Fire TV app.

I'm going to deactivate I think and wait for a version update.

Agent: @240428 Sorry for the continued trouble, Mark, as we'd hate to see you go!

Have you tried connecting your Fire TV to a different HDMI port for comparison?

If no change after, please call/chat us so we can take a closer look on our end: https://t.co/6YdK7bvQN7.

Customer: @hulu_support My monitor has only one port.

Hulu is the only app with an audio delay, and only since the update to this new look a few weeks back.

I also use netflix, crackle, and amazon video with no audio delay.

Customer: @hulu_support Monitor is reliable 4K monitor and all video I watch is through FireTV apps.

I put my Hulu account on hold.

Unless Hulu decides to pay ME to help solve a problem with the hulu FireTV app, I won't spend hrs on the line trying same ineffective troubleshooting I've already done.

Customer: @hulu_support If you want more information about my specific setup (FireTV model/version, monitor, things like that... ), and these will be used in-house by QE team to troubleshoot, I could send that.

Customer: @hulu_support Here's information you can pass along.

Previously, delayed sound occurred with and without bluetooth speaker use.

App JUST got a new update on FireTV.

Now, audio of HDMI seems ok, but bluetooth audio is delayed.

ONLY with the hulu app.

Agent: @240428 We're glad to hear about the improvement, Mark.

We do not support any external audio devices at this stage, which may be why you're having trouble with bluetooth.

We'll definitely pass along the interest, though.

Let us know if we can assist further.
