Customer: @Uber_Support Yes I had an email letting me know one of the 2 lattes were refunded.

So I got the discount of a drink for an entire meal we couldn't even eat.

Very poor customer service

Customer: @Uber_Support The food was ice cold and inedible.

They had put the toppings on waffle and it was so soggy it was like a piece of wet break.

All ice cold due to no driver at the time

Customer: @Uber_Support And I have double checked my email and there is nothing new.

If someone would actually like to contact me, there is a phone number on the account.

I use this a lot and have never complained.

Customer: @Uber_Support The right thing here would've been to just refund the cost of a meal that went in the garbage and not a drink that was a few bucks.

Agent: @710558 Thanks for the feedback, Jenn.
