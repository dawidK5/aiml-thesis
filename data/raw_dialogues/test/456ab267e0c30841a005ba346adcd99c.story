We hear you.

We'd like to check what happened prior to this issue?

What Windows version are you using?

Let us know.

Customer: @MicrosoftHelps I am using Windows 10 Home Single Language.

Nothing specific happened prior to this issue.

Just the service used to leech on to bandwidth (it claims to use idle network but doesn't) .

I want it to stop from resetting Startup type from disabled to automatic.

The service still becomes running after disabling(after a few days).

What can be the reason for the service switching it's startup type ?
