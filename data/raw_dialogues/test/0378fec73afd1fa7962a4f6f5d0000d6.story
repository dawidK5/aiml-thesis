Customer: @sainsburys still acceptable for customers to be submitted to secondhand smoke to enter the store

Agent: @280794 Hi Lee, can you DM us some more info via the link below please?

Customer: @sainsburys I did yesterday and was ignored

Agent: @280794 Sorry Lee.

I can see your concerns were passed to the store manager to look at.

While we can control what happens inside our stores, it's more difficult outside due to it being public space.

Corey

Customer: @sainsburys I understand this, but moving the bins and placing signs out like other establishments manage to do would clearly be a help, would they not?

Agent: @280794 I can appreciate that Lee, that does sound like a good idea.

I've passed your suggestions along to the relevant team so they can be reviewed.

Sorry again.

Corey

Customer: @sainsburys Thank you, itâ€™s not your fault Corey

Agent: @280794 No worries Lee.

Have a great day!

Corey
