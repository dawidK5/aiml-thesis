Customer: @126552 @XboxSupport Controller funktioniert nicht und Microsoft will ihn nicht reparieren weil die Konsole neu ist und Amazon kann nicht reparieren und bietet mir eine vollst√§ndige Erstattung an.

Dabei will ich doch nur mein Scorpio Controller ausgetauscht/repariert!

Agent: @694217 Hey, could you direct message us and explain in detail what issue you are experiencing?

^RM

Customer: @XboxSupport Preordered the xb1x Scorpio ed.

And everything works fine except the controller, which freezes.

Light still on, no button press reaction and os said controller is disconnected.

Happens only with the batteries inside though.

When I take them out and use cable it works (1/2)

Customer: @XboxSupport I called the German MS Support about it and they told me to go back to amazon, since it‚Äôs their issue not MS. Amazon offers me to send it back and give me a refund but all I want is my Scorpio controller working.

Why is that so hard?

Agent: @694217 We understand the frustration with that, but if the controller has an internal issue you would need to follow the return policy for the retailer to get a new one.

Have you been able to test brand new batteries with the controller by chance?

^JL

Customer: @XboxSupport Yep.

With different other batteries - same issue.

Amazon only offers to refund the whole bundle.

But then I‚Äôll lose the Scorpio edition - that is what frustrates me.

Why can‚Äôt you just give me a funtioning one or repair mine?!

I can‚Äôt believe that this ain‚Äôt possible

Agent: @694217 Have you reached out to them to see if they can provide the Scorpio edition?

Just to be  1 ^JL

Agent: @694217 sure, let's have you reach out to our chat team here: https://t.co/aWWrMN54Vu to try and ensure that happens.

Customer: @XboxSupport yea...maybe you go ahead and try the website yourself.

Especially, when you click on Controllers and nothing happens.

Then tried other topic and open chat but nothing happens.

Really REALLY frustrating experience with the support until now.

Unbelievable

Agent: @694217 Hi there!

You can opt to say "No thank you" to the virtual agent.

It will give you more options  1 ^CO

Agent: @694217 to choose.

If the controller option doesn't work, us the accessory option and choose to chat afterward.

This should help.
