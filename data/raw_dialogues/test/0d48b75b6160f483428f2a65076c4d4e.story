Agent: @528448 Try fully closing CoD: IW then clear your console's cache (https://t.co/8flXKTmw8y) before logging back into the game.

Customer: @ATVIAssist I have and still wonâ€™t work..

Agent: @528448 Which platform are you playing on?

^CB

Customer: @ATVIAssist PlayStation

Agent: @528448 If you're still having these issues after clearing your cache your next best bet would be to uninstall / reinstall CoD: IW.

Customer: @ATVIAssist Excuse me ?

Agent: @528448 If you are unable to load into games this is either a problem with your connection or the game itself on your console.
