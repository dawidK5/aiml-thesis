Customer: @delta thanks for the middle seat when I had a perfectly good aisle seat.

Agent: @445354 Lester, I am so sorry for the seating issue.

Agent: @445354 Please provide the flight number so I can take a look at the seat map and reassign if there is availability.

Customer: @Delta Typical @delta flight 1171 to Dallas.

I didn't ask for this.

3 hour flight and last minute changes.

Customer: @Delta Delta 1171

Customer: @Delta There is nothing available but I had a nice aisle seat

Customer: @Delta You're not where I am.

Customer: @Delta Door closing thanks for all your support

Agent: @445354 If the airport has control then I am unable to reassign the seat.

My apologies for the inconvenience.

*HPL

Customer: @Delta Tell the airport to get their act together.

And if you can't do anything then why bother replying.

Agent: @445354 Hmm!

Please give me a minute as I review.

*HPL

Agent: @445354 So you were assigned the complimentary Delta comfort + upgrade which reassign you from your aisle seat to the middle seat.

*HPL

Agent: @445354 Usually once a passenger's seat is reassigned and the airport have not take control of the flight I an able to change the seat.

*HPL

Agent: @445354 My apologies for the frustration we've caused you.

*HPL

Customer: @Delta Thanks but no thanks.

I was 10 on the list so 9 other people said no to the upgrade apparently.

Agent: @445354 Okay, I understand.

*HPL

Customer: @Delta At least the agents in COS asked.

ATL agents need more training.

Agent: @445354 Your feedback is greatly appreciated.

I will forward this to the ATL airport customer service leadership team.
