Customer: It's pointless trying to claim train delay compensation, my journey from Eastbourne to Basingstoke apparently isn't either @121513 or @SW_Help problem.

Neither wants to admit there was a delay on both companies service!

Agent: @372554 @121513 Hi, is it possible for you to DM me details of the journey?

Customer: @SW_Help @121513 Your reference for the claim is DR-8008-2969.

It was that day where people self-evacuated at Waterloo so your train to Basingstoke was delayed by ages

Agent: @372554 @121513 Please can you let me know the date and the time of the train that you were waiting for?

Customer: @SW_Help @121513 Think it was the 2nd October and the 09:12 from Clapham to Basingstoke?

Agent: @372554 @121513 Hello, I've spoken with our customer services team.

They have advised that as your journey originated with Southern, and that 1/2

Agent: @372554 @121513 the initial Southern journey was delayed, you would need to claim compensation for the entire journey from them ^JM 2/2

Customer: @SW_Help Even though your 09:12 train was delayed too?

Agent: @372554 Yes, because the delay from Southern would have caused you to miss your connection onto our service ^JM
