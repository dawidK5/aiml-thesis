Customer: What's the point in @sainsburys double-up when they can't be bothered to stock up on things?

If you don't have something in, at least order it in so that it can be collected from the shop with the double up points!

Agent: @706868 Apologies, was there an item in particular you were looking for?

Steven

Customer: @sainsburys My Mum was looking for Super Mario Odyessy and Sonic Forces for Nintendo Switch.

Agent: @706868 What store do you usually shop in?

I'll take a look on our system for you.

Customer: @sainsburys Sainsburys Scarborough.

They usually have a very poor selection; we have been disappointed in the past, especially when they don't offer to order what you'd like in for you to use on the double up.

Agent: @706868 Thanks for confirming.

Our system is showing that they're due a delivery on the 18th November.

I'd advise calling ahead to avoid an unnecessary journey, their number is 01723 500693...1/2 https://t.co/MdMtnTlX6H

Agent: @706868 ...Using the link, if you DM your postcode I'll check the stock in the other stores in your area.

Customer: @sainsburys Is there a specific time?

Agent: @706868 Unfortunately not, however stock is usually put out on the shelves a day after delivery.

To find out for sure on the day you plan to travel, it would be best to give them a call in advance (01723 500693).

Hope this helps!

Customer: @sainsburys Hypothetically if you were to ring and ask them to hold a copy of both back when they receive this delivery, would they agree to do so to ensure they don't sell out of either game before you get there?

Agent: @706868 As it will still be in our Double Up promotional period, they wouldn't be able to hold any stock for customers.

Sorry to disappoint.

Ewan

Customer: @sainsburys Thanks for the reply.

That's disappointing.

Agent: @706868 You're welcome Sean.
