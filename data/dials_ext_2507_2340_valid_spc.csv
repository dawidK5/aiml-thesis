"cf2de7f27b2d44e04e2a6bcf5ae133d6","Customer: The worst change in MacOS High Sierra is the behavior of the music control buttons on the keyboard. Instead of always working, it only works (sometimes) when the application (iTunes/Spotify) is on the screen. 
 Customer: *Coincidentally* it doesn't seem to work for Spotify at all. @AppleSupport please tell someone somewhere to bring this back to how it was. I use these buttons all day and now (a) nothing happens or (b) the wrong application is affected. 
 Agent: @262669 Let's take a look at what's causing you not to be able to control your iTunes music from your keyboard. To begin, which Mac are you using? Also, is it an external keyboard? 
 Customer: @AppleSupport I'm using a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015). This issue occurs on both an (Apple) external keyboard as well as the built-in one. Sometimes the controls work, but when I have https://t.co/IgleL6FdFT open in Safari it will play its notification sound instead, for example. 
 Agent: @262669 Thank you. Next, is it fully updated to macOS High Sierra 10.13.1? What version of iTunes are you using? 
 Customer: @AppleSupport Both are fully up-to-date. I'm pretty sure this is a 'feature', not a bug, though. As of High Sierra the media keys seem to be binding to the last opened 'controllable' app. It's just that it happens to bind to the wrong apps (like https://t.co/IgleL6FdFT in Safari). 
 Agent: @262669 The media keys now control playback for the app you are currently using. If you are using Safari, pressing the play/pause key will attempt to perform this action in Safari. We encourage you to provide feedback concerning this here:  https://t.co/eTPVYVFyd8 
 Customer: @AppleSupport Thanks for the clarification. I‚Äôve found a third party app that fixes this issue, but I‚Äôll be sure to leave feedback. Thanks!
